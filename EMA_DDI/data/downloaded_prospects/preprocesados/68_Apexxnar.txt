4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 Different injectable vaccines should always be administered at different vaccinati on sites.Do not mix Prevenar 20with other vaccines or medicinal products in the same syringe. 7Paediatric population 
 In infants and children ,6weeks to less than 5 years of age, Prevenar 20can be administered concomitantly with any of the following vaccine antigens, either as monovalent or combination vaccines: diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b, inactivated poliomyelitis, measles, mumps, ru bella, and varicella vaccines. In clinical trials, rotavirus vaccines w erepermitted to be administered concomitantly with Prevenar 20and no safety concerns were observed.Individuals 18 years of age and older 
 Prevenar 20may be administered concomitantly with seasonal influenza vaccine (QIV; surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted). In subjects with underlying conditions associated with a high risk of developing life -threatening pneumococcal disease, consideration may be given to separating administrations of QIV and Prevenar 20(e.g.,by approximately 4 weeks). In a double -blind, randomised study (B7471004) in adults 65 years of age and older, the immune response was formally non-inferior, however numerically lower titre s were observed for allpneumococcal serotypes included in Prevenar 20when given concomitantly with seasonal influenza vaccine (QIV, surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) compared to when Prevenar 20was given alone. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown .Prevenar 20can be administered concomitantly with COVID -19 m 
 RNA vaccine (nucleosidemodified).There are no data on the concomitant administration of Prevenar 20with other vaccines.
