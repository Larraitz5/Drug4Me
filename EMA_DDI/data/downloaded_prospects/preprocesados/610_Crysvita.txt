4.5 Interaction with other med icinal products and other forms of interaction 
 Concurrent administration of burosumab with oral phosphate and  active vitamin  D analogues is contraindicated as it may cause an increased risk of hyperphosphatemia and hypercalcaemia (see section 
4.3). 
 Caution should be exercised when combining burosumab with calcimimetic medicinal products (i.e. agents that mimic the effect of calcium on tissues by activating the calcium receptor). Co -administration of these medicinal products has not been studied in clinical trials and could potentially exacerbate hypocalcaemia.
