4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interactio n 
 5 Specific interaction studies have not been performed with hydroxycarbamide.  
 Potentially fatal pancreatitis and hepatotoxicity, and severe peripheral neuropathy have been reported in HIV -infected patients who received hydroxycarbamide in combination with first generation antiretroviral medicinal products, particularly didanosine pl us stavudine. Patients treated with hydroxycarbamide in combination with didanosine, stavudine, and indinavir showed a median decline in CD4 cells of approximately 100/mm3. 
 Concurrent use of hydroxycarbamide and other myelosuppressive medicinal products or radiation therapy may increase bone marrow depression, gastro -intestinal disturbances or mucositis. An erythema caused by radiation therapy may be aggravated by hydroxycarbamide.  
 Concomitant use of hydroxycarbamide with a live virus vaccine may potentiate the replication of the vaccine virus and/or may increase the adverse reaction of the vaccine virus, because normal defence mechanisms may be suppressed by hydroxycarbamide therapy. Vaccination with a live vaccine in a patient taking hydroxycarba mide may result in severe infections. Generally, the patient's antibody response to vaccines may be decreased. Treatment with Siklos and concomitant immunisation with live virus vaccines should only be performed if benefits clearly outweigh potential risks .
