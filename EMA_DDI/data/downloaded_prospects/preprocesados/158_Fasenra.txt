4.5 Interaction with other medic inal products and other forms of interaction 
 No interaction studies have been performed. In a randomi sed, double -blind parallel -group study of 103 patients aged between 12 and 21 years with severe asthma, the humoral antibody responses induced by seasonal influenza virus vaccination do not appear to be affected by benralizumab treatment. An effect of benralizuma b on the pharmacokinetics of co -administered medicinal products is not expected (see section 5.2).Cytochrome P450 enzymes, efflux pumps and prote in-binding mechanisms are not involved in the clearance of benralizumab. There is no evidence of IL -5RÎ± expression on hepatocytes. Eosinophil depletion does not produce chronic systemic alterations of proinflammatory cytokines .
