4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No interaction studies have been performed. 
 The co-administration of agents known to inhibit T cell function has not been formally studied. The co-administration of agents known to stimulate T cell function has not been investigated and the effects are unknown. 
 Tocilizumab or siltuximab and corticosteroid use 
 Some patients required tocilizumab or siltuximab and/or corticosteroid for the management of CRS (see section 4.8). The use of tocilizumab or siltuximab and/or corticosteroids for CRS management was more common in patients with higher cellular expansion. 
 In the Kar 
 MMa-3 study, patients with CRS treated with tocilizumab or siltuximab had higher Abecma cellular expansion levels, as measured by 3.1-fold and 2.9-fold higher median C max (N = 156) and AUC 0-28days  (N = 155), respectively, compared to patients who did not receive tocilizumab or siltuximab (N = 64 for C max and N = 63 for AUC 0-28days ). Patients with CRS treated with corticosteroids had higher Abecma cellular expansion levels, as measured by 2.3-fold and 2.4-fold higher median C max (N = 60) and AUC 0-28days  (N = 60), respectively, compared to patients who did not receive corticosteroids (N = 160 for C max and N = 158 for AUC 0-28days ). 
 Similarly, in the Kar 
 MMa study, patients with CRS treated with tocilizumab had higher Abecma cellular expansion levels, as measured by 1.4-fold and 1.6-fold higher median C max (N = 66) and AUC 0-28days (N = 65), respectively, compared to patients who did not receive tocilizumab (N = 61 for Cmax and N = 60 for AUC 0-28days ). Patients with CRS treated with corticosteroids had higher Abecma 11 cellular expansion levels, as measured by 1.7-fold and 2.2-fold higher median C max (N = 18) and AUC 0-28days  (N = 18), respectively, compared to patients who did not receive corticosteroids (N = 109 for C max and N = 107 for AUC 0-28days ). 
 Live vaccines 
 The safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines during or following treatment with Abecma has not been studied. As a precautionary measure, vaccination with live vaccines is not recommended for at least 6 weeks prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, during Abecma treatment and until immune recovery following treatment.
