4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 CYP3A4 inhibitors 
 Strong CYP3A4 i nhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromyci n, ritonavir) can significantly increase systemic exposure to atogepant . Co-administration of atogepant with itraconazole resulted in increase dexposure (Cmax by 2.15 -fold and AUC by 5.5 -fold) of atogepant in healthy subjects (seesection 4.2).Changes in atogepant exposure when co -administered with weak or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors are not expected to be clinically significant.Transporter inhibitors 
 Organic anion transporting polypeptide ( OATP )inhibitor s (e.g., rifampicin, ciclosporin , ritonavir )can significantly increase systemic exposure to atogepant . Co-administration of atogepant with single dose rifampi cin resulted in increase dexposur e (Cmax by 2.23 -fold an d AUC by 2.85 -fold)of atogepant in healthy subjects (see section 4.2) .Frequently co -administered medicinal products 
 Co-administration of atogepant with oral contraceptive components ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, paracetamol, naproxen, sumatrip tan, or ubrogepant did not result in significant pharmacokinetic interactions for either atogepant or co -administered medicinal products .Co-administration with famotidine oresomeprazole did not result in clinically relevant changes of atogepant exposure.
