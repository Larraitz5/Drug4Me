4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction   Micafungin has a low potential for interactions with medicines metabolised via CYP3A mediated pathways.  
 Drug interaction studies in healthy human subjects were conducted to evaluate the potential for interaction between micafungin an d mycophenolate mofetil, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, prednisolone, sirolimus, nifedipine, fluconazole, ritonavir, rifampicin, itraconazole, voriconazole and amphotericin B. In these studies, no evidence of altered pharmacokinetics of micafungin was observed. No micafungin dose adjustments are necessary when these medicines are administered concomitantly. Exposure (AUC) of itraconazole, sirolimus and nifedipine was slightly increased in the presence of micafungin (22%, 21% and 18% respectively).  
 Co-administrat ion of micafungin and amphotericin B desoxycholate was associated with a 30% increase in amphotericin B desoxycholate exposure. Since this may be of clinical significance this co -administration should only be used when the benefits clearly outweigh the ris ks, with close monitoring of amphotericin B desoxycholate toxicities (see section 4.4).  
  6 Patients receiving sirolimus, nifedipine or itraconazole in combination with micafungin should be monitored for sirolimus, nifedipine or itraconazole toxicity and the sirolimus, nifedipine or itraconazole dosage should be reduced if necessary (see section 4.4).
