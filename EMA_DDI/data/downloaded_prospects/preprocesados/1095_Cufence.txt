4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No interaction studies have been performed.  
 Zinc 
 There are insufficient data to support the  concomitant use of zinc and trientine. The combination of trientine with zinc is not recommended as interaction of zinc with trientine is likely, th ereby  reducing the effect of both active substances.  
 Other anti -copper agents 
 No interaction studies have been performed on the concomitant administration of trientine with D-Penicillamine.  
 Food 
 Trientine is poorly absorbed following oral intake and food further inhibits trientine absorption. Specific food interaction studies have been performed with trientine in healthy subjects, showing a reduction of the extent of absorption of trientine up to 45%. Systemic exposure is critical for its principal mechanism of action, copper chelation (see section  5.1). Therefore, it is recommended that trientine is  taken  at least 1 hour before meals or 2  hours after meals and at least one hour apart from any other medicinal product, food, or milk t o allow for maximum absorption and reduce the likelihood of the formation of complexes by metal binding in the gastrointestinal tract (see section  4.2). 
 Other products  
 Trientine has been found to reduce serum iron levels.  Therefore, i ron supplementation may be necessary in some cases. Concomitant oral iron  or other heavy metals should be administred at a different time  than trientine to prevent the formation of complexes (see section  4.4). 
 Although t here is no evidence that calcium and magnesium antacids alter the efficacy of trientine, it is  good practice to sep arate their administration  (see section  4.4).
