4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No interacti on studies have been performed.  
 Medicinal products that may increase plasma potassium or induce hyperkalaemia  
 Concomitant use of Sibnayal with medicinal  products that may increase potassium levels or induce hyperkalaemia  (e.g.  ACE inhibitors, potassium -sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, ciclosporin or other medicinal products such as heparin sodium or nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory medicinal products ) necessitates monitoring of pota ssium plasma levels  (see section 4.4) .  
 Medicinal products affected by plasma  potassium disturbances  
 Periodic monitoring of plasma  potassium and ECG is recommended when Sibnayal  is administered with medicinal products affected by plasma  potassium disturbances due to the potential risk for a pro-arrhythmic effect (e.g. digitalis glycosides, corticosteroids , anti -arrhythmics such as quinidine, amiodarone, chlorpromazine, cisapride or sparfloxacine) . 
 Medicinal products affected by increased urine p 
 H  
 Patients with d 
 RTA  have alkaline urine due to their proton secretion defect. This may impact the excretion of the medicinal product into the urine (such as an increase of the elimination of salicylates, tetracyclines, and barbiturates and a decrease in the elimination of quinidine) or reduce the effectiveness of methenamine. As Sibnayal may further increase urine p 
 H to a small extent, the interaction of alkaline urine with these medications may be enhanced.
