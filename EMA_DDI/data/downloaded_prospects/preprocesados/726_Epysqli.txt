4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 No interaction studies have been performed. Based on the potential inhibitory effect of eculizumab on complement -dependent cytotoxicity of rituximab, eculizumab may reduce the expected pharmacodynamic effects of rituximab.  
 Plasma exchange (PE), plasmapheresis (PP), fresh frozen plasma infusion (PI) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) have been shown to reduce eculizumab serum levels. A supplemental dose of eculizumab is required in these settings. See Section 4.2 for guida nce in case of concomitant PE, PP, PI, or IVIg treatment.  
 Concomitant use of eculizumab with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) may reduce effectiveness of eculizumab. Closely monitor for reduced effectiveness of eculizumab.  
 Concomitant use of eculizumab with neonatal Fc receptor (Fc 
 Rn) blockers may lower systemic exposures and reduce effectiveness of eculizumab. Closely monitor for reduced effectiveness of eculizumab.
