4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Methylnaltrexone bromide does not affect the pharmacokinetics of medicinal products metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes. Methyl naltrexone bromide is minimally metabolised by CYP isozymes. In vitro  metabolism studies suggest that methylnaltrexone bromide does not inhibit the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP2B6, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP3A4, while it is a weak inhibitor of the m etabolism of a model CYP2D6 substrate. In a clinical drug interaction study in healthy adult male subjects, a subcutaneous dose of 0.3  mg/kg of methylnaltrexone bromide did not significantly affect the metabolism of dextromethorphan, a CYP2D6 substrate.  
  The organic cation transporter (OCT) -related drug -drug interaction potential between methylnaltrexone bromide and an OCT inhibitor was studied in 18 healthy subjects by comparing the single -dose pharmacokinetic profiles of methylnaltrexone bromide before a nd after multiple 400 mg doses of cimetidine. The renal clearance of methylnaltrexone bromide was reduced following 5 multiple -dose administration of cimetidine (from 31 L /h to 18 L /h). However, this resulted in a small reduction in total clearance (from 107 L /h to 95 L /h). Consequently, no meaningful change in AUC of methylnaltrexone bromide, in addition to C max, was observed before and after multiple -dose administration of cimetidine.
