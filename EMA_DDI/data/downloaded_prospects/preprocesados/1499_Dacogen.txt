4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 No formal clinical drug interaction studies with decitabine have been conducted.There is the potential f or a drug -drug interaction with other agents which are also activated by sequential phosphorylation (via intracellular phosphokinase activities) and/or metaboli sed by enzymes implicated in the inactivation of decitabine (e.g., cytidine deaminase). Therefor e, caution should be exercised if these active substances are combined with decit abine.5Impact of co -administered medicinal products on decitabine 
 Cytochrome ( CYP ) 450-mediated metabolic interactions are not anticipated as decitabine metabolism is not med iated by this system but by oxidative deamination .Impact of decitabine on co -administered medicinal products 
 Given its low in vitro plasma protein binding ( ï€¼1%), decitabine is unlikely to displace co-administered medicinal products from their plasma pro tein binding. Decitabine has been shown to be a weak inhibitor of P -gp mediated transport in vitro and is therefore ,also not expected to affect P-gp mediated transport of co -administered medicinal products (see section 5.2).
