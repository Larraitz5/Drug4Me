4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No clinical pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies have been performed. An in vitro  study indicates that teduglutide does not inhibit cytochrome  P450 drug metabolising enzymes. Based upon the pharmacodynamic effect of teduglutide, there is a poten tial for increased absorption of concomitant medicinal products (see section  4.4).
