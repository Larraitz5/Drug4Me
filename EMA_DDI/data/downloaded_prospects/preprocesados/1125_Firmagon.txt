4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been performed.  
 Since androgen deprivation treatment may prolong the QTc interval, the concomitant use of degarelix with medic inal products known to prolong the QTc interval or medicinal product s able to induce torsades de pointes such as class IA ( e.g. quinidine, disopyramide) or class III (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide)  antiarrhythmic medicinal products , methadone,  moxifloxacin, antipsychotics,  etc. should be carefully evaluated (see section 4.4).  
 Degarelix is not a substrate for the human CYP450 system and has not been shown to induce or inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4/5 to any great extent in vitro . Therefore, clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug -drug interactions in metabolism related to these isoenzymes are unlikely.
