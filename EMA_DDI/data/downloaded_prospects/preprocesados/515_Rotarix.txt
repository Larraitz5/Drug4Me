 Rotarix can be given concomitantly with any of the following monovalent or combination vaccines [including hexavalent vaccines (DTPa -HBV- IPV/Hib)]: diphtheria -tetanus -whole cell pertussis vaccine (DTPw), diphtheria -tetanus- acellular pertussis vaccine (DTPa), Haemophilus influenzae  type b vaccine (Hib), inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), hepatitis B vaccine (HBV), pneumococcal conjug ate vaccine and meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccine. Clinical studies demonstrated that the immune responses and the safety profiles of the administered vaccines were unaffected.

 Concomitant administration of Rotarix and oral polio vaccine (OPV) does not affect the immune response to the polio antigens. Although concomitant administration of OPV may slightly reduce the immune response to rotavirus vaccine, clinical protection against severe rotavirus gastro -enteritis was shown to be maintained in a  clinical trial involving more than 4 200 subjects who received Rotarix concomitantly with OPV.  There are no restrictions on the infantâ€™s consumption of food or liquid, either before or after vaccination.
