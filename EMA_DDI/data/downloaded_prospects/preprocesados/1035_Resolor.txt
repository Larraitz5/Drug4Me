4.5 Interact ion with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 Prucalopride has a low pharmacokinetic interaction potential . It is extensively excreted unchanged in urine (approximately 60% of the dose) and in vitro metabolism is very slow.Prucaloprid e did not inhibit specific CYP450 activities in in vitro studies in human liver microsomes at therapeuti cally relevant concentrations.Although p rucalopride may be aweak sub strate for 
 P-glycoprotein ( P-gp), it is not an inhibitor of P -gpat clinically re levant concentrations.Effects of prucalopride on pharmacokinetics of other medicin al products 
 A 30% increase in plasma concentrations of erythromycin was found during prucalopride co-administration. The mechanism for this interaction is not clear.Pruca lopride had no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, digoxin, alcohol, paroxetine or oral contraceptives.Effects of other medicinal products on pharmacokinetics of prucalopride 
 Ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily ), a potent inhibi tor of CYP3A4 and of P -gp, increased the system icexposure to prucalopride by approximately 40%. This effect is too small to be clinically relevant .4Interactions of similar magnitude may be expected with other potent inhibitors of P -gp such as verapamil , cyclosporine A and quinidine.Therapeutic doses of probenecid, cimetidine, erythromycin and paroxetine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride.
