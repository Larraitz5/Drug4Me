4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Naloxone elicits a pharmacological response due to the interaction with opioids and opioid agonists.  When administered to opioid dependent subjects , naloxone can cause acute  withdrawal symptoms  in some individuals .  Hy pertension, cardiac arrhythmias, pulm onary oedema and cardiac arrest have been described, more typically when naloxone is used post -operatively  (see sections 4.4 and 4.8) . 
 Administration of Nyxoid may decrease the analgesic effects of opioids used primarily to provide pain relief, due to its  antagonist properties  (see section 4.4) . 
 When administering naloxone to patients who have received buprenorphine as an analgesic, complete analgesia may be restored.  It is thought that this effect is a result of the arch -shaped dose -response curve of bu prenorphine with decreasing analgesia in the event of high doses.  However, reversal of respiratory depression caused by buprenorphine is limited.
