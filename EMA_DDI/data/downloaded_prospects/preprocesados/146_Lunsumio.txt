4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  No interaction studies have been performed.   A transient clinically relevant effect on CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. warfarin, voriconazole, cyclosporine, etc) cannot be excluded, since initiation of Lunsumio treatment causes a transient increase in cytokine levels which may cause inhibition of CYP450 enzymes. On initiation of Lunsumio therapy in patients being treated with CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, therapeutic monitoring should be considered. The dose of the concomitant medicinal product should be adjusted as needed.
