4.5 Interaction with other medicin al products and other forms of interaction  
 Effect of other medicinal products on Xermelo  
 Short acting octreotide  Concomitant administration of short -acting octreotide with Xermelo  significantly decreased the systemic exposure of telotristat ethyl and telotristat, the active metabolite (see section 5.2).  Short- acting octreotide should be administered at least 30 minutes after administration of Xermelo  if treatment with short -acting octreotide is needed in combination with Xermelo . 
 Carboxylesterase 2 (CES 2) inhibitors  The IC 50 of the inhibition of loperamide on the metabolism of telotristat ethyl by CE S2 was 5.2  µM (see section 5.2).  In phase 3  clinical studies , telotristat  was routinely combined with loperamide  with no evidence of safety concerns.  
 Effect of Xermelo  on other medicinal products  
 CYP2B6 substrates  Telotristat induced CYP2B6  in vitro  (see section 5.2) . Concomitant use of Xermelo may decrease the efficacy of medicinal products that are CYP2B6 substrates (e.g. valproic acid , bupropion, sertraline) by decreasing their systemic exposure.  Monitor ing for suboptimal efficacy  is recommended . 
 CYP3A4 substrates  Concomitant use of Xermelo may decrease the efficacy of medicinal pr oducts  that are CYP3A4 substrates (e.g. midazolam, everolimus, sunitinib,  simvastatin, ethiny loestradiol, amlodipine, cyclospori ne…) by decreasing their systemic exposure  (see section 5.2) . Monitor ing for suboptimal efficacy  is recommended . 
 Carboxylesterase 2 (CES 2) substrates  Concomitant use of Xermelo  may change the exposure of medicinal products that are CES2 substrates (e.g. prasugrel, irinotecan, capecitabine and flutamide) (see section 5.2).  If co-administration is unavoidable, monitor for suboptimal efficacy and adverse reactions .
