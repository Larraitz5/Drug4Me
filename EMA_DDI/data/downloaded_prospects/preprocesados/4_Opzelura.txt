4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 No interaction studies have been performed  with topically administered ruxolitinib.  
 The potential for interactions with ruxolitinib is considered to be low because of the limited systemic exposure following topical administration.  
 Based on in vitro  data, ruxolitinib is predominantly cleared by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) metabolism. Interaction potential was evaluated for oral ruxolitinib in dedicated clinical pharmacology studies that included co -administration of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors or a strong inducer. The plasma AUC is approximately doubled with co -administration of a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 while only a modest increase was seen with co -administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor.  
 The use of ruxolitinib cream in combination with other topical medicinal products used to treat vitiligo has not been evaluated and co -application on the same skin areas is not recommended.  
 Other topical medicinal products used to treat other conditions on the same skin areas should be applied with a minimum of 2  hours after the application of ruxolitinib cream. This is also applicable to the use of sunscreen or emollients.
