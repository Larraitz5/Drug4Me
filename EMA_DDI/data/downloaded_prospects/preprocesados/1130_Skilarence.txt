4.5 Interaction w ith other medicinal products a nd other for ms of in teraction  
 No interaction studies have be en performed.  
 Skilarence should be used cautiously in combination with other  systemic antipsoriatic therapy (e.g. methotrexate, retinoi ds, psoralens , ciclo sporin, i mmunosuppressants or  cytostati cs) (see sect ion 4.4 ). During treatment , simu ltaneous use of other fumaric acid derivatives (topical or systemic) should be avoided.  
 Concurrent therapy with nephrotoxic substances  (e.g. methotrexate, ciclosp orin, aminoglycosides, diuretics , non-steroi dal anti -inflam matory drugs ( NSAIDs ) or lithium) may increase t he potential for renal adverse reactions (e.g. proteinuria) in patients taking Skilarence . 
 In cases of  severe or prolonge d diarrhoea  during t reatment with Skilarence, abs orption of other  medicinal products may be affec ted. Caution should be exercised when  prescribing medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic index that require absorption in the intestinal tract.  The effi cacy of oral contrace ptives ma y be reduced and the use of an alter native barrier contraceptive met hod is recommended to  prevent possibl e failure of contraception (see the prescribing information of the oral contraceptive).  
 Consumption of  large quantities of strong alcoholic drinks (mo re than 30% alcohol by volume) shoul d be avoided because it may lead  to increased dissolu tion rates of Sk ilarence and, therefore, may increase the frequency of gastrointestinal adverse reactions.  
 Vaccination  during treatment w ith Skilarence  has n ot been s tudied . Immunosuppre ssion is a risk factor for the use of live vacci nes. The risk of vacc ination should be weighed against the benefit.  
 There is no evidence for  interaction with  cytochrome  P450 an d the most common efflux and uptake transporters , thus no i nteractio ns are expected with medicinal products  metaboli sed or tran sported  by these system s (see section  5.2). 7
