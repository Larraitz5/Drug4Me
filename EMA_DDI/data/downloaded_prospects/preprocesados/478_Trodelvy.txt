 UGT1A1 inhibitors  
 Concomitant administration of sacituzumab govitecan  with inhibitors of UGT1A1 may increase the incidence of adverse reactions due to potential increase in systemic exposure to SN-38. Sacituzumab govitecan  should be used with caution in patients receiving UGT1A1 inhibitors (e.g. propofol, ketoconazole, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors).  
 UGT1A1 induce rs 
 Exposure to SN -38 may be reduced in patients concomitantly receiving UGT1A1 enzyme inducers. Sacituzumab govitecan  should be used with caution in patients receiving UGT1A1 inducers (e.g. carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin, ritonavir, tipranavir ).  
 Based on the limited data available from patients who received UGT1A1 inhibitors ( n=16)  or inducers (n=5) while being treated with sacituzumab govitecan, free SN-38 exposures  in these patients were comparable to those in patients who did not receive UGT1A1  inhibitor or inducer.
