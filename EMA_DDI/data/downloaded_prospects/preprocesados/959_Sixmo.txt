4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of intera ction  
 No interaction studies have been performed with Sixmo . 
 Buprenorphine should not be administered  together with:  
• Opioid antagonists: naltrexone and nalmefene can block the pharmacological effects of buprenorphine. Co-administration during buprenorphine treatment is contraindicated due to the 16 potentially dangerous interaction that may precipitate a sudden onset of prolonged and intense opioid withdrawal symptoms (see section 4.3).  
• Alcoholic drinks or medicinal products  containing alcohol, as alcohol increases the sedative effect of buprenorphine. Sixmo is contraindicated in acute alcoholism (see section 4.3).  
 Buprenorphine should be used cautiously when co-administered with:  
• Benzodiazepines: This combination may result in death due to respiratory depression of central origin. Therefore, doses must be limited and this combination must be avoided in cases where there is a risk of misuse. Patients should be warned that it is extremely dangerous to self -administer non-prescribed benzodiazepines while taking this product, and should also be cautioned to use benzodiazepines concurrently with this product only as directed by their healthcare professional (see section 4.4).  
• Gabapentinoids: This combination may result in death due to respiratory depression. Therefore, dosages must be closely monitored and this combination must be avoided in cases where there is a risk of misuse. Patients should be cautioned to use gabapentinoi ds (such as pregabalin and gabapentin) concurrently with this product only as directed by their physician (see section 4.4).  
• Other CNS  depressants: Other opioid derivatives (e.g. methadone, analgesics and antitussives), certain antidepressants, sedative H1 -receptor antagonists, barbiturates, anxiolytics other than benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, clonidine and related substances: these com binations increase CNS  depression. The reduced level of alertness can make driving and using machines hazardous  (see section 4.7) .  
• Opioid analgesics: Adequate analgesia may be difficult to achieve when administering a full opioid agonist in patients receiving buprenorphine. Therefore , the potential to overdose with a full agonist exists, especially when attempting to overcome buprenorphine partial agonist effects, or when buprenorphine plasma levels are declining (see section 4.4) . 
• CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers: Buprenorphine is metabolized to norbuprenorphine primarily by CYP3A4; therefore, potential interactions may occur when buprenorphine  is given concurrently with medicinal products  that affect CYP3A4 activity. CYP3A4 inhibitors may inhibit the metabolism of buprenorphine resulting in increased Cmax and AUC of buprenorphine  and nor buprenorphine . Patients treated with CYP inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazodone, verapamil, diltiazem, amiodarone, amprenavir, fosamprenavir, aprepitant, fluconazole, erythromycin and grapefruit juice) should be monitored for signs and symptoms of toxicity or overdose (miosis, lip cyanosis, sedation, bradycardia , hypotension, respiratory depression). In case toxicity or overdose symptoms are observed, the removal of  the implants and transition to a medic inal product  that allows dose adjustment are required . 
• Similarly, inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g. phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin) may have the potential to reduce buprenorphine plasma concentrations because of increased metabolism of buprenorphine to norbuprenorphine.  
• Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI): Possible exacerbation of the effects of opioids, based on experience with morphine.  
• Serotonergic medicinal products, such as MAO inhibitors, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine re -uptake inhibitors (SNRIs) or tricyclic antidepressants as the risk of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, is increased (see section 4.4).
