4.5 Interactio n with ot her medici nalproducts and other forms of interaction 
 Do not administer Fluenz Tetra to children and adolescents rec eiving salicylate t herapy(see section 4.3). Do not use salicylates in childr en and adolescents for 4weeks after vaccination unless medic ally indic ated as 
 Reyeâ€™s syndrome has been reported following the use of salicylates during wild -type influenza infec tion.The co -admin istration of trivalent Fluenz with the live attenu ated vaccines: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella and orally -administe red poliov irus has been studied. No clinically meaningful changes in immune responses to measles, mumps, varicella, o rally-administered poliovirus or Fluenz have been observed. The immun e response to rubella vaccine was significantly altered. Howe ver, this alteratio nmightnot be of clinical relevance with the two dose immunisation schedule of the rubella vaccine. This o bserva tion with tri valent 
 Fluenz is relevant to the use of Fluenz Tet ra because Fluenz Tetra (influenza vaccine -liveattenuated, na sal) is i dentical t o 
 Fluenz with the only difference being the addition of a fourth strain (a second B strain) to Fluenz Tetra .Theco-administr ationof Fluenz Tetra with inactivated vaccines ha s not been studied.The concurrent use of Fluenz Tetra with antiviral agents th at are active against influenza A and/or B viruses has not been evaluated. However, based upon the potentia l for influenza ant iviralagents to reduce the effectiveness of Fluen z Tetra, it is recommended not to administer the vaccineuntil48hours after th ecessation of influenza antiviral therapy. Administration of influenza antiviral agents within two weeks o f vacc ination may a ffectthe response of the vaccine.If influenza a ntiviral agents and Fluenz Tetra are administered concomitant ly, revac cination s hould be considered based on clinical judgement.
