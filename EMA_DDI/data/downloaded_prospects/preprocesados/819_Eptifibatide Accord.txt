4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Warfarin and dipyridamole  Eptifibatide  did not appear to increase the risk of major and minor bleeding associated with  concomitant use of warfarin and dipyridamole. Eptifibatide  -treated patients who had a prothrombin  time (PT) >  14.5 seconds and received warfarin concomitantly did not appear to be at an increased risk  of bleeding.  
 Eptifibatide  and thrombolytic agents  Data are limited on the use of eptifibatide  in patients receiving thrombolytic agents. There was no  consistent evidence that eptifibatide  increased the risk of major or minor bleeding associated with  tissue plasminogen activator in either a PCI or an acute myocardial infarction study. Eptifibatide  appeared to increase the risk of bleeding when administered with streptokinase in an acute myo cardial  infarction study. The combination of reduced dose tenecteplase and eptifibatide compared to placebo  and 6 eptifibatide significantly increased the risk of both major and minor bleeding when administered  concomitantly in an acute ST -elevation myocardi al infarction study.  
 In an acute myocardial infarction study involving 181 patients, eptifibatide (in regimens up to a bolus  injection of 180  microgram/kg, followed by an infusion up to 2  microgram/kg/min for up to 72  hours)  was administered concomitantly  with streptokinase (1.5 million units over 60  minutes). At the highest  infusion rates (1.3  microgram/kg/min and 2.0  microgram/kg/min) studied, eptifibatide was associated  with an increased incidence of bleeding and transfusions compared to the incidence s een when  streptokinase was given alone.
