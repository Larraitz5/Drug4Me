>  A drug- drug interaction study assessing the effect of KETOCONAZOLE, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, on the  pharmacokinetics of bortezomib (injected intravenously), showed a mean bortezomib AUC increase of  
35% (CI 90% [1.032 to 1.772]) based on data from 12 patients. Therefore, patients should be closely monitored when given bortezomib in combination with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. KETOCONAZOLE,  RITONAVIR). 
> A drug- drug interaction study assessing the effect of rifampicin, a potent CYP3A4 inducer, on the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib (injected intravenously), showed a mean bortezomib AUC reduction of 45% based on data from 6 patients. Therefore, the concomitant use of bortezomib with strong  CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampicin, CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENYTOIN, PHENOBARBITAL and St. Johnâ€™s Wort) is  not recommended, as efficacy may be reduced. 
> A drug- drug interaction study assessing the effect of MELPHALAN-prednis one on the pharmacokinetics of  bortezomib (injected intravenously), showed a mean bortezomib AUC increase of 17% based on data  from 21 patients. This is not considered clinically relevant.
