> Concomitant use of rifampicin decreased the AUC 0-inf of ganaxolone by approximately 57- 68%. Enzyme  inducing ANTIEPILEPTICS (e.g., CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENYTOIN, PHENOBARBITAL, and PRIMIDONE)  and St. John’s Wort may  result in similarly  lower plasma exposures of ganaxolone. In patients on a stable dose of ganaxolone or in patients  initiating or increasing the dose of concomitant enzyme -inducing antiepileptic drugs  or St. John’s Wort a  dose increase may be necessary; however, do not exceed the maximum daily dose (see section  4.4). 
> Coadministration of ganaxolone with ITRACONAZOLE, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased the ganaxolone AUC by 17% in healthy subjects (the C max was unchanged). The changes in ganaxolone exposures when coadministered with strong, moderate, or weak CYP3A4 inhibitors are not expected to be clinically significant.
