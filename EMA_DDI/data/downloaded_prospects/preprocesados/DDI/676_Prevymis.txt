4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
> General inf ormation about dif f erences in exposure between dif f erent letermovir treatment regimens 
-The estimated letermovir plasma exposure is dif f erent depending on the dose regimen used (see tablein section 5.2). Theref ore, the clinical consequences of  drug interactions for letermovir will bedependent on which letermovir regimen is used and whether or not letermovir is combined withcyclosporine.
-The combination of  CYCLOSPORINE and letermovir may lead to more marked or additional ef f ects onconcomita nt medicinal products as compared to letermovir alone (see Table 1).Ef fect of  other medicinal products on letermovir
> Co-administration of  PREVYMIS
 (with or without CYCLOSPORINE) with strong and moderate inducersof  transporters (e.g., P-gp) and/or ENZYMES (e.g., UGTs) is not recommended, as it may lead tosubtherapeutic letermovir exposure (see Table 1).
> 
-Examples of  strong inducers include rif ampicin, PHENYTOIN, CARBAMAZEPINE, St
. John’s wort(Hypericum perforatum
), rif abutin and PHENOBARBITAL.
-Examples of  moderate inducers include THIORIDAZINE, modaf inil, RITONAVIR, LOPINAVIR, ef avirenz andetravirine . Rif ampicin co
-administration resulted in an initial increase in letermovir plasma concentrations (due to
> Inhibitors of OATP1B1 or 3 Co-administration of  PREVYMIS with medicinal products that are inhibitors of  OATP1B1/3transporters may result in increased letermovir plasma concentrations. If  PREVYMIS is co

> Medicinal products mainly eliminated through metabolism or influenced by active transport Letermovir is a general inducer  in vivo of  ENZYMES and transporters . Unless a particular enzyme ortransporter is also inhibited (see below) induction can be expected. Theref ore , letermovir maypotentially lead to decreased plasma exposure and possibly reduced ef f icacy of  co
-administeredmedicinal products that are mainly eliminated through metabolism or by active transport
.The size of  the induction ef f ect is dependent on letermovir route of  administration and whethercyclosporine
 is concomitantly used
. The f ull induction ef f ect can be expected af ter 10
-14 days ofletermovir treatment. The time needed to reach steady state of  a specif ic aff ected medicinal productwill also inf luence the time needed to reach f ull ef f ect on the plasma concentrations.In vitro
, letermovir is an inhibitor of
 CYP3A, CYP2C8, CYP2B6, BCRP, UGT1A1, OATP2B1, and
> CYP3A4, P -gp, OATP1B1/3 additionally on CYP2C19. The net ef f ect in vivo  on the other listedenzymes and transporters is not known.  Detailed inf ormation is presented below.It is unknown whether letermovir may af f ect the exposure of  PIPERACILLIN/TAZOBACTAM, amphotericine Band MICAFUNGIN. The potential interaction between letermovir and these medicinal products have notbeen investigated. There is a theoretical risk of  reduced exposure due to induction but the size of  theeff ect and thus clinical relevance is presently unknown.Medicinal products metabolised by CYP3ALetermovir is a moderate inhibitor of  CYP3A
 in vivo . Co-administration of  PREVYMIS
 with oralmidazolam (a CYP3A substrate) results in 2
-3-f old increased MIDAZOLAM plasma concentrations. Co
-administration of  PREVYMIS
 may result in clinically relevant increases in the plasma concentrationsof  co -administered CYP3A substrates (see sections 4.3, 4.4, and 5.2). 
-Examples of  such medicinal products include certain IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS (e.g., CYCLOSPORINE,TACROLIMUS, SIROLIMUS), HMG
-Co
> A reductase inhibitors, and AMIODARONE (see Table 1). PIMOZIDE andergot alka loids are contraindicated (see section 4.3).The size of  the CYP3A inhibitory ef f ect is dependent on letermovir route of  administration andwhether CYCLOSPORINE is concomitantly used.Due to time dependent inhibition and simultaneous induction the net enzyme inhibitory ef f ect may notbe reached until af ter 10
-14 days. The time needed to reach steady state of  a specif ic af f ectedmedicinal product will also inf luence the time needed to reach f ull ef f ect on the plasma concentrations.When ending treatment, it takes 10
-
14 days f or the inhibitory ef f ect to disappear. If  monitoring isapplied, this is recommended the f irst 2 weeks af ter initiating and ending letermovir (see section 4.4)as well as af ter changing route of  letermovir administration.7Medicinal products transported  by OATP1B1/3Letermovir is an inhibitor of  OATP1B1/3 transporters
. Administration of  PREVYMIS
 may result in aclinically relevant increase in plasma concentrations of  co-administered medicinal products that are
> A reductase inhibitors, f exofenadine,REPAGLINIDE and GLYBURIDE (see Table 1). Comparing letermovir regimen administered withoutcyclosporine, the ef f ect is more marked af ter intravenous
 than oral letermovir. The magnitude of the OATP1B1/3 inhibition on co
-administered medicinal products is likely greaterwhen PREVYMIS
 is co -administered with CYCLOSPORINE (a potent OATP1B1/3 inhibitor). This
 needsto be considered when the letermovir regimen is changed during treatment with an OATP1B1/3substrate.Medicinal products metabolised by CYP2C9 and/or CYP2C19Co-administration of  PREVYMIS
 with VORICONAZOLE (a CYP2C19 substrate) results in signif icantlydecreased VORICONAZOLE plasma concentrations, indicating that letermovir is an inducer of  CYP2C19.CYP2C9 is likely also induced. Letermovir has the potential to decrease the exposure of  CYP
2C9and/or CYP2C19 substrates potentially resulting in subtherapeutic levels. 
-Examples of  such medicinal products include warf arin, VORICONAZOLE, DIAZEPAM, LANSOPRAZOLE,OMEPRAZOLE, ESOMEPRAZOLE, PANTOPRAZOLE, TILIDINE, TOLBUTAMIDE (see Table 1).
 The eff ect is expected to be less pronounced f or oral letermovir without CYCLOSPORINE, than intravenousletermovir with or without CYCLOSPORINE, or oral letermovir with CYCLOSPORINE. This needs to beconsidered when the letermovir regimen is changed during treatment with a CYP2C9 or CYP2C19substrate.  See also general inf ormation on induction above regarding time courses of the interaction.Medicinal products metabolised by CYP2C8Letermovir inhibits CYP2C8 in vitro  but may also induce CYP2C8 based on its induction potential
.The net ef f ect in vivo is unknown. 
-An e xample of  a medicinal product which is mainly eliminated by CYP2C8 is REPAGLINIDE (see
> Table  1)
. Concomitant use of  REPAGLINIDE and letermovir with or without CYCLOSPORINE is notrecommended.Medicinal products transported by P-gp in the intestine
> Letermovir is an inducer of  intestinal P
-gp. Administration of  PREVYMIS
 may result in a clinicallyrelevant decrease in plasma concentrations of co
-administered medicinal products that aresignif icantly transported by P
-gp in the intestine such as DABIGATRAN and
 SOFOSBUVIR.Medicinal products metabolised by CYP2B6, UGT1A1 or transported by BCRP or OATP2B1Letermovir is a general inducer
 in vivo but has also been observed to inhibit CYP2B6, UGT1A1
,BCRP, and OATP2B1
 in vitro
. The net ef f ect in vivo  is unknown. Theref ore
, the plasmaconcentrations of medicinal products that are substrates of these ENZYMES or transporters may increaseor decrease when co
-administered with letermovir. Additional monitoring may be recommended; ref erto the prescribing inf ormation f or such medicinal products.
 
- Examples of  medicinal products that are metabolised by CYP2B6 include BUPROPION.
- Examples of  medicinal products metabolised by UGT1A1 are RALTEGRAVIR and DOLUTEGRAVIR.
- Examples of  medicinal products transported by BCRP include ROSUVASTATIN and sulf asalazine.
- An example of  a medicinal product transported by OATP2B1 is CELIPROLOL.Medicinal products transported by the renal transporter OAT3In vitro  data indicate that letermovir is an inhibitor of  OAT3; theref ore, letermovir may be an OAT3inhibitor in vivo . Plasma concentrations of  medicinal products transported by OAT3 may be increased.
-Examples of  medicinal products transported by OAT3 includes ciprof loxacin, tenof ovir, IMIPENEM,and cilastin.8General inf ormation
