> No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with EPOETIN ALFA alters the metabolism of other medicinal products. Medicinal products that decrease erythropoiesis may decrease the response to EPOETIN ALFA.Since cyclosporin is bound by RBCs there is potential for a medicinal product interaction. If EPOETIN ALFA is given concomitantly with cyclosporin, blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises. No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between EPOETIN ALFA and GRANULOCYTE COLONY-STIMULATING FACTOR (G-CSF) or granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro. In female adult patients with metastatic breast cancer, subcutaneous co-administration of 40 000 IU/m
