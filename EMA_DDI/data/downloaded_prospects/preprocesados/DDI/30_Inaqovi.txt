> Because DECITABINE is a substrate for the cytidine deaminase (CDA) enzyme, which metaboli ses DECITABINE resulting in an inactive deaminated form, other medicinal products inhibiting CDA  should be avoided, as co-administration may result in increased DECITABINE exposure. 
> Cedazuridine is an inhibitor of CDA and thereby increases the exposure of DECITABINE following oral administration . Concomitant administration of INAQOVI with medicinal products metabolised by CDA (i.e., CYTARABINE, GEMCITABINE, AZACITIDINE ) may result in increased systemic exposure with a potential for increased toxicity of these medicinal products . Co- administration of INAQOVI with medicinal products metabolised primarily  by CDA should be avoided .
