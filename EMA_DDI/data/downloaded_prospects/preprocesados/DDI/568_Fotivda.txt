> Contraindication of concomitant use  Herbal preparations containing ST. JOHN'S WORT ( Hypericum perforatum ) are cont raindicated.  If a patient is already taking St John’s wort, this should be stopped before starting tivozanib treatment. The inducing effect of St John’s wort may persist for at least 2 weeks after cessation of treatment with St John’s wort (see section 4. 3).
> Strong CYP3A4 inducers  In a clinical study in healthy volunteers, co -administration of a single 1 340 microgram dose of tivozanib with a strong CYP3A4 inducer at steady -state (RIFAMPIN 600  mg once daily) decreased the average half -life of tivozanib from 121 to 54  hours which was associated with a decrease in the  single dose AUC 0-∞ of 48% compared with AUC 0-∞ in the absence of RIFAMPIN.  Average C max and AUC 0-24hr were not significantly affected (8% increase and 6% decrease respectively). The clinical  effects of strong CYP3A4 inducers on repeated daily dosing of tivozanib has not been studied but potentially the average time to reach steady -state and the average steady -state serum concentration of tivozanib may be reduced, due to the reduction in half -life.  It is recommended that concomitant administration of tivozanib with strong CYP3A4 inducers,  if used,  should be undertaken with caution.    Moderate CYP3A4 inducers are not expected to have a clinically relevant effect on  tivozanib  exposure .
