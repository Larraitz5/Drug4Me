> BUDESONIDE is metaboli sed via CYP3A4.  Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 can increase plasma levels of BUDESONIDE. Co- administration of the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor KETOCONAZOLE or intake of GRAPEFRUIT JUICE resulted in a 6.5- fold and 2- fold increase, respectively in the bioavailability of BUDESONIDE, compared to BUDESONIDE alone. 
> Thus, clinically relevant interactions with potent CYP3A inhibitors, such as KETOCONAZOLE, ITRACONAZOLE, RITONAVIR, INDINAVIR, saq uinavir, ERYTHROMYCIN, CYCLOSPORINE, and GRAPEFRUIT JUICE, are to be expected, and may increase systemic BUDESONIDE concentrations (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
> Concomitant treatment with CYP3A4 inducers such a s CARBAMAZEPINE may reduce BUDESONIDE systemic exposure. 
> The pharmacokinetics of BUDESONIDE have not been evaluated in combination with PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS (PPIS). In a study assessing intragastric and intraduodenal p
