> Plavin with oral anticoagulants is not recommended since it may increase the intensity of bleeding (see section 4.4).  Although the administration of CLOPIDOGREL 
75 mg/day did not modify the pharmacokinetics of S -WARFARIN or International Normalised Ratio (INR) in patients receiving long- term WARFARIN therapy, coadministration of CLOPIDOGREL with WARFARIN increases the risk of bleeding because of independent effects on hemostasis.  
> Plavin and HEPARIN is possibl e, leading to increased risk of bleeding. Therefore, concomitant use should be undertaken with caution (see section 4.4). 
> Thrombolytics  The safety of the concomitant administration of CLOPIDOGREL, fibrin or non- fibrin specific thrombolytic agents and heparins was assessed in patients with acute myocardial infarction. The incidence of clinically significant bleeding was similar to that observed when thrombolytic agents and HEPARIN are co-administered with ASA (see section 4.8). The safety of the concomi tant administration of Duo
>  7 NSAIDs  In a clinical study conducted in healthy volunteers, the concomitant administration of CLOPIDOGREL and NAPROXEN increased occult gastrointestinal blood loss. Consequently, the concomitant use of NSAIDs including Cox- 2 inhibitors is not recommended (see section 4.4). 
> METAMIZOLE  METAMIZOLE may reduce the effect of ASA on platelet aggregation when taken concomitantly. Therefore, this combination should be used with caution in patients taking low dose ASA for cardioprotection . 
> SSRIs  Since SSRIs affect platelet activation and increase the risk of bleeding, the concomitant administration of SSRIs with CLOPIDOGREL should be undertaken with caution. 
> Other concomitant therapy with CLOPIDOGREL 
> Inducers of CYP2C19  Since CLOPIDOGREL is metabolis ed to its active metabolite partly by CYP2C19, use of medicinal products that induce the activity of this enzyme would be expected to result in increased drug levels of the active metabolite of CLOPIDOGREL. 
> Rifampicin strongly induces CYP2C19 resulting to both an increase level of CLOPIDOGREL active metabolite and platelet inhibition, which in particular might potentiate the risk of bleeding. As a precaution, concomitant use of strong CYP2C19 inducers should be discouraged (see section 4.4). 
> Inhibitors of CYP2C19  Since CLOPIDOGREL is metabolised to its active metabolite partly by CYP2C19, use of medicinal products that inhibit the activity of this enzyme would be expected to result in reduced drug levels of the active metabolite of CLOPIDOGREL. The clinical relevance of this interaction is uncertain. As a precaution concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP2C19 inhibitors  should be discouraged (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
> PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS  (PPI)  OMEPRAZOLE 80  mg once daily administered either at the same time as CLOPIDOGREL or with 12 hours between the administrations of the two drugs decreased the exposure of the active metabolite by 45% (loading dose) and 40% (maintenance dose). The decrease was associated with a 39% (loading dose) and 21% (maintenance dose) reduction of inhibition  of platelet aggregation. ESOMEPRAZOLE is expected to give a similar interaction with CLOPIDOGREL.  
> Inconsistent data on the clinical implications of this pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) interaction in terms of major cardiovascular events have been reported from both observational and clinical studies. As a precaution, concomitant use of OMEPRAZOLE or esomepr azole should be discouraged (see section 4.4). 
> Less pronounced reductions of metabolite exposure has been observed with PANTOPRAZOLE or LANSOPRAZOLE.   8 The plasma concentrations of the active metabolite was 20% reduced (loading dose) and 14% reduced (maintenance dose) during concomitant treatment with PANTOPRAZOLE 80 mg once daily. This was associated with a reduction of the mean inhibition of platelet aggregation by 15% and 11%, respectively. These results indicate that CLOPIDOGREL can be administered with PANTOPRAZOLE. 
> A significantly reduced platelet inhibition has been shown in HIV patients treated with RITONAVIR -or COBICISTAT -boosted ART. Although the clinical relevance of these findings is uncertain, there have been spontaneous reports of HIV -infected patients treated with RITONAVIR boosted ART, who have experienced re- occlusive events after de- obstruction or have suffered thrombotic events under a CLOPIDOGREL loading treatment schedule. Average platelet inhibition can be decreased with concomitant use of CLOPIDOGREL and RITONAVIR. Therefore, concomitant use of clopidog rel with ART boosted therapies should be discouraged. 
> Other medicinal products  A number of other clinical studies have been conducted with CLOPIDOGREL and other concomitant medicinal products to investigate the potential for pharmacodynamic and pharmacoki netic (PK) interactions. No clinically significant pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when CLOPIDOGREL was co -administered with ATENOLOL, NIFEDIPINE, or both ATENOLOL and NIFEDIPINE. Furthermore, the pharmacodynamic activity of CLOPIDOGREL was not significantly influenced by the co- administration of PHENOBARBITAL or oestrogen. 
> CYP2C8 substrate medicinal products: CLOPIDOGREL has been shown to increase REPAGLINIDE exposure in healthy volunteers. In vitro  studies have shown the increase in REPAGLINIDE exposure is due to inhibition of CYP2C8 by the glucuronide metabolite of CLOPIDOGREL. Due to the risk of increased plasma concentrations, concomitant administration of CLOPIDOGREL and drugs pr imarily cleared by CYP2C8 metabolism (e.g., REPAGLINIDE, PACLITAXEL) should be undertaken with caution (see section 4.4) .
> ROSUVASTATIN: CLOPIDOGREL has been shown to increase ROSUVASTATIN exposure in patients by 1.4- fold (AUC) without effect on Cmax, after repeated administration of a 75 mg CLOPIDOGREL dose. 
> METHOTREXATE  Due to the presence of ASA, METHOTREXATE used at doses higher than 20 mg/week should be used with caution with Duo
> TENOFOVIR  Concomitant administration of te nofovir disoproxil fumarate and NSAIDs may increase the risk of renal failure.   9  VALPROIC ACID  The concomitant administration of salicylates and VALPROIC ACID may result in decreased VALPROIC ACID protein binding and inhibition of VALPROIC ACID metabolism r esulting in increased serum levels of total and free VALPROIC ACID .
> Acetazolamid e Caution is r ecommended when co -administering salicylates with ACETAZOLAMIDE as there is an increased risk of metabolic acidosis. 
> NICORANDIL  In patients  concomitantly receiving NICORANDIL and NSAIDs  including ASA and LAS , there is an increased risk for severe complications such as gastrointestinal ulceration, perforation and haemorrhage  (see section 4.4). 
> Other interactions with ASA  Interactions with the  following medicinal products with higher (anti -inflammatory) doses of ASA have also been reported: angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, PHENYTOIN, beta  blockers, DIURETICS, and oral hypoglycemic agents . 
> Alcohol  Alcohol may increase the risk of gastrointestinal injury when taken with ASA. Patients should be counseled about the risks of gastrointestinal injury and bleeding while taking CLOPIDOGREL plus ASA with alcohol, especially if alcohol consumption is chronic or heavy. (See section 4. 4.)
> Other interactions with CLOPIDOGREL and ASA  More than 30,000 patients entered into clinical trials with CLOPIDOGREL plus ASA at maintenance doses lower than or equal to 325 mg, and received a variety of concomitant medicinal products including diureti cs, beta  blockers, ACE Inhibitors, CALCIUM antagonists, cholesterol lowering agents, coronary vasodilators, antidiabetic agents (including insulin), antiepileptic agents and GPIIb/IIIa antagonists without evidence of clinically significant adverse interact ions.
