> Coadministration of multiple 200 mg doses of ITRACONAZOLE with a single 125 mg p albociclib dose increased palbociclib total exposure (AUC inf) and the peak concentration (Cmax) by approximately 87% and 34%, respectively, relative to a single 125 mg palbociclib dose given a lone. The concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors including, but not limited to:CLARITHROMYCIN, INDINAVIR, ITRACONAZOLE, KETOCONAZOLE, LOPINAVIR /RITONAVIR, NEFAZODONE, NELFINAVIR, POSACONAZOLE, SAQUINAVIR, TELAPREVIR, TELITHROMYCIN, VORICONAZOLE ,and grapefruit or GRAPEFRUIT JUICE, should be avoided (see section s4.2 and 4.4).No dose adjustments are needed for mild and moderate CYP3A inhibitors.Effect of CYP3A inducers
> Coadministration of multiple 600 mg doses of RIFAMPIN with a single 125 mg palbociclib dose decreased palbociclib AUC infand C maxby 85% and 70%, respectively, relative to a single 125 mg palbociclib dose given alone.The concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers including, but not limited to: CARBAMAZEPINE ,ENZALUTAMIDE, phenyto in, RIFAMPIN, and St. Johnâ€™s Wort should be avoided (see sections 4.3 and 4.4) .Coadministration of multiple 400 mg daily doses of MODAFINIL, a moderate CYP3A inducer, with a single 125 mg IBRANCE dose decreased palbociclib AUC infand C maxby 32% and 11%, respectively, relative to a single 125 mg IBRANCE dose given alone. No dose adjustments are required for moderate CYP3A inducers (see section 4.4).Effect of acid reducing agents Under fed conditions (intake of a moderate -fat meal ),coadministration of multiple doses of the protonpump inhibitor (PPI) RABEPRAZOLE with a single dose of 125mg IBRANCE decreased palbociclib C max8by 41%, but had limited impact on AUC inf(13% decrease) compared with a single dose of 125mg IBRANCE administered alone.Under fasting conditions , the coadministration of multiple doses of the PPI RABEPRAZOLE with a single dose of 125mg IBRANCE decreased palbociclib AUC infand C maxby 62% and 80%, respectively .Therefore, IBRANCE should be taken with food , preferably a meal (see sections 4.2 and 5.2) .Given the reduced effect on gastric p
> Palbociclib is a weak ,time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A following daily 125 mg dosing at steady state. Coadministration ofmultiple doses of palbociclib with MIDAZOLAM increased the MIDAZOLAM AUC infand C maxvalues by 61% and 37%, respectively, as compared with administration of MIDAZOLAM alone.The dose of sensitive CYP3A substrate swith a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., ALFENTANIL, CYCLOSPORINE, DIHYDROERGOTAMINE, ERGOTAMINE, EVEROLIMUS, FENTANYL, PIMOZIDE, QUINIDINE, SIROLIMUS ,and TACROLIMUS) may need to be reduced when coadministered with IBRANCE as IBRANCE may increase their exposure. Drug -drug interaction between palbociclib and LETROZOLE Data from the drug -drug interaction (DDI) evaluation portion of a clinical study in patients with breast cancer showed that there was no drug interaction between palbociclib and LETROZOLE w hen the 
2medicinal products were coadministered. Effect of TAMOXIFEN on palbociclib exposure
> DDI studies of palbociclib with oral contraceptives have not been conducted (see section 4.6).In vitro studies with transporters Based on in vitro data, palbociclib is predicted to inhibit intestinal P -glycoprotein (P -gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) mediated transport. Therefore, administration of palbociclib with medicinal products that are substrates of P -gp(e.g., DIGOXIN, DABIGATRAN, COLCHICINE) or BCRP (e.g., PRAVASTATIN ,ROSUVASTATIN, FLUVASTATIN, SULFASALAZINE) may increase their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions. Based on in vitro data, palbociclib may inhibit the uptake t ransporter organic cationic transporter OCT1 and then may increase the exposure of medical product substrates of this transporter (e.g., METFORMIN).9Drug -drug interaction between palbociclib and statins
> Concomitant use of palbociclib with statins which are substrates of CYP3A4 and/or BCRP may increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis due to increased statin plasma concentration. Cases of rhabdomyolysis including fatal cases have been reported following coadministration of palbociclib with SIMVASTATIN or atorva statin.
