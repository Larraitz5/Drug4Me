> Nevirapine is an inducer of CYP3A and potentially CYP2B6, with maximal induction occurring within 2 -4 weeks of initiating multiple -dose therapy. Compounds using this metabolic pathway may have decreased plasma concentrat ions when co -administered with nevirapine . Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effectiveness of P450 metabolised medicinal products is recommended when taken in combination with nevirapine .The absorption of nevirapine is not affected by food, ANTACIDS or medicinal products which are formulated with an alkaline buffering agent.The interaction data is presented as geometric mean value with 90% confidence interval (90% CI) whenever these data were available. ND = Not Determined, ↑ = Increased, ↓ = Decrea sed, = No Effect
> Granulocytopenia is commonly associated with ZIDOVUDINE. Therefore, patients who receive nevirapine and ZIDOVUDINE concomitantly and especially paediatric patients and patients who receive higher ZIDOVUDINE doses or patients with poor bone marrow reserve, in particular those with advanced HIV disease, have an increased risk of granuloc ytopenia. In such patients haematological parameters should be carefully monitored.NNRTIs

No significant effect on RIFABUTIN and VIRAMUNE mean PK parameters is seen. RIFABUTIN and VIRAMUNE can be co-administered without dose adjustments. However, d ue to the high interpatient variability some patients may experience large increases in RIFABUTIN exposure and may be at higher risk for RIFABUTIN toxicity.

Adefovir did not influence any of the common CYP isoforms known to be involved in human drug metabolism and is excreted renally. No clinically relevant drug -drug interaction is expected.Adefovir and VIRAMUNE may be coadministered without dose adjustments.ENTECAVIR ENTECAVIR is not a substrate, inducer or an inhibitor of c ytochrome P450 (CYP450) ENZYMES.

JOHN'S WORT (Hypericum perforatum ). This is due to induction of medicinal product metabolism ENZYMES and/or transport proteins by St. John’s Wort.Herbal preparations containing St. John‘s Wort and VIRAMUNE must not be co -administered (see section 4.3). If a patient is already taking St. John‘s Wort check nevirapine and if possible viral levels and stop St. John‘s Wort. Nevirapine levels may increase on stopping St. John‘s Wort. The dose of VIRAMUNE may need 15adjusting. The inducing effect may persist for at least 2 weeks after cessation of treatment with St . John‘s Wort.Other information:Nevirapine m etabolites: Studies using human liver microsomes indicated that the formation of nevirapine hydroxylated metabolites was not affected by the presence of DAPSONE, RIFABUTIN, rifampicin, and TRIMETHOPRIM/SULFAMETHOXAZOLE. KETOCONAZOLE and ERYTHROMYCIN significantly inhibited the formation of nevirapine hydroxylated metabolites.
