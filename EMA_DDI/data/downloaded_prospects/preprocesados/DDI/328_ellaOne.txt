> One with CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. barbiturates (incl uding PRIMIDONE and PHENOBARBITAL), PHENYTOIN, FOSPHENYTOIN, CARBAMAZEPINE , OXCARBAZEPINE, herbal medicines containing Hypericum perforatum  (St. Johnâ€™s wort), rifampicin, RIFABUTIN, GRISEOFULVIN, EFAVIRENZ and NEVIRAPINE) therefore  reduces plasma concentrations of ulipristal acetate and may result in a decreased efficacy of ella
> The CYP3A4 inhibitor RITONAVIR can also have an inducing effect on CYP3A4 when RITONAVIR is used for a longer period. In such cases RITONAVIR might reduce plasma concentrations of ulipristal acetate. Concomitant use is therefore not recommended  (see section 4.4 ). Enzyme induction wears off slowly and effects on the plasma concentrations of ulipristal acetate may occur even if a woman has stopped taking an enzyme inducer in the past 4  weeks. 
> H Administration of ulipristal aceta te (10 mg tablet) together with the proton pump inhibitor ESOMEPRAZOLE (20 mg daily for 6 days) resulted in approximately 65% lower mean Cmax, a delayed T max  5 (from a median of 0.75 hours to 1.0 hours) and 13% higher mean AUC. The clinical relevance of this interaction for single dose administration of ulipristal acetate as emergency contraception is not known.
> Hormonal contraceptives  Because ulipristal acetate binds to the PROGESTERONE receptor with high affinity, it may interfere with the action of progestogen- containing medicinal products:  
- Contraceptive action of combined hormonal contraceptives and progestogen-only contraception may be reduced  
- Concomitant use of uliprista l acetate and emergency contraception containing LEVONORGESTREL is not recommended  (see section  4.4).
