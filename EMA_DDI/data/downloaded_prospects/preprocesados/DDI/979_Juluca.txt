> METFORMIN  DOLUTEGRAVIR increased METFORMIN concentrations. A dose adjustment of METFORMIN should be considered when starting and sto pping co- administration of DOLUTEGRAVIR/RILPIVIRINE  with METFORMIN, to maintain glycaemic control (see section 4.5). METFORMIN is eliminated renally and therefore it is of importance to monitor renal function when co- treated with DOLUTEGRAVIR/RILPIVIRINE . This combination may increase the risk for lactic acidosis in patients with mode rate renal impairment (stage 3a creatinine clearance [Cr
> DOLUTEGRAVIR is eliminated mainly through metabolism by URIDINE diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (UGT )1A1. DOLUTEGRAVIR is also a substrate of UGT1A3, UGT1A9, cytochrome P450 ( CYP )3A4, P -glycoprotein ( P-gp), and breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ); therefore medicinal products that induce those ENZYMES may decrease DOLUTEGRAVIR plasma concentration and reduce the therapeutic effect of DOLUTEGRAVIR (see Table 1). Co-administration of DOLUTEGRAVIR/RILPIVIRINE  and other medicinal products that inhibit these ENZYMES may increase DOLUTEGRAVIR plasma concentration (see Table 1). 
> RILPIVIRINE is primarily metabolised by CYP 3A. Medicinal products that induce or inhibit CYP3A may thus affect the clearance of RILPIVIRINE (see section 5.2). Co -administration of DOLUTEGRAVIR/RILPIVIRINE  with medicinal products that induce CYP3A may result in  decrease d plasma concentrations of RILPIVIRINE, which could reduce the therapeutic effect of DOLUTEGRAVIR/RILPIVIRINE  (see Table 1) . Co-administration of 6 DOLUTEGRAVIR/RILPIVIRINE  with medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A may result in  increased plasma concentratio ns of RILPIVIRINE  (see Table 1) . In patients with severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease, the combination of DOLUTEGRAVIR/RILPIVIRINE  with a strong CYP3A inhibitor should only be used if the benefit outweighs the risk  (see section  4.2).

> H may result in decreased plasma concentrations of RILPIVIRINE which could potentially reduce the therapeutic effect of DOLUTEGRAVIR/RILPIVIRINE .
> In vitro , DOLUTEGRAVIR inhibited the renal organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2)  and multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter 1 (MATE 1). In vivo , a 10 -14% decrease of creatinine clearance ( secretory fraction is dependent on OC T2 and MATE1  transport ) was observed in patients. In vivo, DOLUTEGRAVIR may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products in which excretion is dependent upon OCT2 and/ or MATE1 (e.g. FAMPRIDINE  [also known as dalfampridine] , METFORMIN) (see Table 1  and sections  4.3 and 4.4 ).
> In vitro , DOLUTEGRAVIR inhibited the renal  uptake transporter s, organic anion transporters  (OAT )1 and OAT3. Based on the lack of effect on the in vivo  pharmacokinetics of the OAT substrate TENOFOVIR , in vivo  inhibition of OAT1 is unlikely. Inhibition of OAT3 has not been studied in vivo . DOLUTEGRAVIR may increase plasma concentrations of medic inal products in which excretion is dependent upon OAT3. 
> RILPIVIRINE inhibits P -gp in vitro  (IC
50 is 9.2 μM). In a clinical study, RILPIVIRINE did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of DIGOXIN. However, it may not be completely excluded that RILPIVIRINE can increase the exposure to other medicinal products  transported by P -gp that are more sensitive to intestinal P -gp inhibition, e.g. DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE.
