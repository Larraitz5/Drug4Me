> Interaction studies have only been performed in healthy adults (aged ≥18years).Active substances that may increase SELUMETINIB plasma concentrations
> Co-administration with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (200 mg ITRACONAZOLE twice daily for 4 days) increased SELUMETINIB C maxby 19% (90% CI 4, 35) and AUC by 49% (90% CI 40, 59) in healthy adult subjects .Co-administration with a strong CYP2C19/moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (200 mg fluconazol e once daily for 4 days) increased SELUMETINIB C maxby 26% (90% CI 10, 43) and AUC by 53% (90% CI 44, 
63) in healthy adult subjects , respectively.Concomitant use of ERYTHROMYCIN (moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) or FLUOXETINE (strong CYP2C19/CYP2D6 inhibitor) is predicted to increase SELUMETINIB AUC by ~30-40% and C maxby 
~20%.Co-administration with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., CLARITHROMYCIN, GRAPEFRUIT JUICE, oral KETOCONAZOLE) or
> CYP2C19 (e.g., ticlopi dine) should be avoided. Co-administration with moderateinhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. , ERYTHROMYCIN and FLUCONAZOLE) and CYP2C19 (e.g. ,OMEPRAZOLE) should be avoided . If co-administration is unavoidable ,patients should be carefully monitored for adverse ev ents andthe SELUMETINIB dose should be reduced (see section 4.2 and Table 4).Active substances that may decrease SELUMETINIB plasma concentrations
> Co-administration with a strong CYP3A4 inducer (600 mg rifampicin daily for 8 days) decr eased SELUMETINIB Cmaxby -26% (90% CI -17, -34) and AUC by -51% (90% CI -47, -54).Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., PHENYTOIN, rifampicin, CARBAMAZEPINE, St.John’s Wort) or moderate CYP3A4 inducers with KOSELUGO should be avoided.Active substances whose plasma concentrations may be altered by SELUMETINIB
> H modifying agents (i.e. ,H2-RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS and PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS) without restrictions , except for OMEPRAZOLE which is a CYP2C19 inhibitor .Vitamin E8Koselugo capsules contain VITAMIN E as the excipient TPGS. Therefore, patients should avoid taking supplemental VITAMIN E and anticoagulant assessments should be performed more frequently in patients taking concomitant anticoagulant or antiplatelet medici nal products (see section 4.4).
