> Gastric, gastro -oesophageal junction or oesophageal adenocarcinoma Patients who had baseline ECOG performance score â‰¥ 2, untreated CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM metastases, active, known, or suspected autoimmune disease, or medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression were excluded from the clinical study in gastric, GEJ or oesophageal adenocarcinoma (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). In the absence of data, nivolumab in combination with chemotherapy should be used with caution in these populations after careful consideration of the potential benefit/risk on an individual basis.
