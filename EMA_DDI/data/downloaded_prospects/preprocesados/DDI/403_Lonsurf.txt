> In vitro  studies indicated that TRIFLURIDINE is a substrate for the nucleoside transporters CNT1, ENT1 and ENT2. Therefore, caution is required when using medicinal products that interact with these transporters. TIPIRACIL HYDROCHLORIDE was a substrate for OCT2 and MATE1, therefore, the concentration might be increased when LONSURF is administered concomitantly with inhibitors of OCT2 or MATE1. 
> Caution is required when using medicinal products  that are human thymidine kinase substrates, e.g., ZIDOVUDINE. Such medicinal products, if used concomitantly with LONSURF, may compete with the effector, TRIFLURIDINE, for activation via thymidine kinases. Therefore, when using antiviral medicinal product s that are human thymidine kinase substrates, monitor for possible decreased efficacy of the antiviral medicinal product, and consider switching to an alternative antiviral medicinal product that is not a human thymidine kinase substrate, such as lamivudin e, DIDANOSINE and ABACAVIR  (see section 5.1 ).
