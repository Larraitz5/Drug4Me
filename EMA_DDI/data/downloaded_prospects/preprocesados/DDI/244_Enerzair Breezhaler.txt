> Like other medicinal products containing a beta 2-adrenergic agonist, this medicinal product should be administered with caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic ANTIDEPRESSANTS, or medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval, as any effect of these on the QT interval may be potentiated. Medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval may increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmia (see section s 4.4 and 5.1). 
> Concomitant hypokalaemic  treatment with methylxanthine derivatives, steroids, or non-POTASSIUM -sparing DIURETICS may potentiate the possible hypokalaemic effect of beta 2-adrenergic agonists (see section  4.4).
> Due to the very low plasma concentration achieved after inhaled dosing, clinically significant interactions with MOMETASONE furoate are unlikely. However, there may be a potential for increased systemic exposure to MOMETASONE furoate when strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. KETOCONAZOLE, ITRACONAZOLE, NELFINAVIR, RITONAVIR, COBICISTAT) are co -administered. 
> In a clinical study in healthy volunteers, CIMETIDINE, an inhibitor of orga nic cation transport which is thought to contribute to the renal excretion of glycopyrronium, increased total exposure (AUC) to glycopyrronium by 22% and decreased renal clearance by 23%. Based on the magnitude of these changes, no clinically relevant drug  interaction is expected when glycopyrronium is co -administered with CIMETIDINE or other inhibitors of the organic cation transport.
