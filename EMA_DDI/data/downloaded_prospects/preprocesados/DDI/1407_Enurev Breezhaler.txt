> In a clinical study in healthy volunteers, CIMETIDINE, an inhibitor of organic cation transport which is thought to contribute to the renal excretion of glycopyrronium, increased total exposure (AUC) to glycopyrronium by 22% and decreased renal clearance by 2 3%. Based on the magnitude of these changes, no clinically relevant drug interaction is expect ed when glycopyrronium  is co-administered with CIMETIDINE or other inhibitors of organic cation transport. 
> Concomitant administration of glycopyrronium  and orally inhaled INDACATEROL, a beta 2-adrenergic agonist, under steady -state conditions of both active substances did not affect the pharmacokinetics of either medicinal product.
