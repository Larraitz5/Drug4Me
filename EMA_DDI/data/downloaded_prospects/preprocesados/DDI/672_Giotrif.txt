> Invitro studies have demonstrated that a fatinib is a substrate of P -gpand BCRP .When the strong P -gp and BCRP inhibitor RITONAVIR (200 mg twice a day for 3days) was administered 1 hour before a single dose of 20 mg GIOTRIF , exposure to afatinib increased by 48% (area under the curve (AUC 0-∞))and 
39% (maximum plasma concentration (Cmax)). In contrast, when RITONAVIR was a dministered simultaneously or 6 hours after 40mg GIOTRIF , the relative bioavailability of afatinib was 
119% (AUC 0-∞) and 104% (Cmax) and 111% (AUC 0-∞) and 105% (Cmax), respectiv ely. Therefore, it is recommended to administer strong P -gp inhibitors (including but not limited to RITONAVIR, CYCLOSPORINE A, KETOCONAZOLE, ITRACONAZOLE, ERYTHROMYCIN, VERAPAMIL, QUINIDINE, TACROLIMUS, 7nelfinavir, SAQUINAVIR, and AMIODARONE) using staggered dosing , preferably 6hours or 12 hours apart from GIOTRIF (seesection 4.2).Effects of P -gp inducers on afatinib
> Pre-treatment with rifampicin (600 mg once daily for 7 days), a potent inducer of P -gp, decreased the plasma exposure to afatinib by 34% (AUC 0-∞) and 22% (Cmax) after administration of a single dose of 
40mg GIOTRIF .Strong P -gp inducers ( including but not limited to rifampicin, CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENYTOIN, PHENOBARBITAL or St. John’s wort(Hypericum perforatum) ) may decrease exposure to afatinib (seesection 4.4).Effects of afatinib on P -gp substrates
> Based on invitro data, afatin ib is a moderate inhibitor of P -gp. However, based on clinical data i t is considered unlikely that GIOTRIF treatment will result in changes of the p lasma concentrations of other P -gp substrates .Interactions with BCRPInvitro studies indicate dthat afatinib is a substrate and an inhibitor of the transporter BCRP. Afatinibmay increase the bioavailability of orally administered BCRP substrates (including but not limited torosuvastatin and SULFASALAZINE ).Food effect on afatinib
> Co-administration of a high -fat meal with GIOTRIF resulted in a significant decrease of exposur e to afatinib by about 50% in regard to C maxand 39% in regard to AUC 0-∞. This medicinal product should be administ ered without food (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
