> In rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and Crohnâ€™s disease patients, there are indications that concomitant use of METHOTREXATE and other immunomodulators reduces the formation of antibodies against infliximab and increases the plasma concentrations of infliximab. However, the results are uncertain due to limitations in the methods used for serum analyses of infliximab and antibodies against infliximab.
> The combination of infliximab with other biological therapeutics used to treat the same conditions as infliximab, including ANAKINRA and ABATACEPT, is not recommended (see section 4.4).
