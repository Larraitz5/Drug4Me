> 4 In vivo  idebenone is a mild  inhibitor of CYP3A4. Data from a drug -drug interaction study in 
32 healthy volunteers indicate that on the first day of oral administration of 300 mg idebenone t.i.d., the metabolism of MIDAZOLAM, a CYP3A4 substrate, was not modified  when both medicinal products were administered together. After repeated administration C max and AUC of MIDAZOLAM  were increased by 28% and 34 %, respectively, when MIDAZOLAM  was administered in combination with 300  mg idebenone t.i.d. Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as ALFENTANIL, ASTEMIZOLE, TERFENADINE, CISAPRIDE, CYCLOSPORINE, FENTANYL, PIMOZIDE, QUINIDINE, SIROLIMUS, TACROLIMUS, or ERGOT ALKALOIDS  (ERGOTAMINE, DIHYDROERGOTAMINE) should be administered with caution in patients receiving idebenone . 
> Idebenone may inhibit P-glycoprotein ( P-gp) with possible exposure increases of , e.g., DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE, DIGOXIN or ALISKIREN.  These medicines should be administered with caution in patients receiving idebenone .  Idebenone is not a substrate for P-gp in vitro .
