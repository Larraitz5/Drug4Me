> Concomitant administration with DIURETICS, antihypertensive agents, or other vasodilators
> Concomitant administration of TREPROSTINIL with DIURETICS, antihypertensive agents or other vasodilators increases the risk of systemic hypotension.
> TREPROSTINIL may inhibit platelet function. Concomitant administration of TREPROSTINIL with plat elet aggregation inhibitors , including NSAIDs, NITRIC OXIDE donors or anticoagulants may increase the risk of bleeding. Surveillance of patients taking anticoagulants should be closely maintained. The concomitant use of other platelet inhibitors should be avoided in patients taking anticoagulants. 
> Rifampicin and other CYP2C8 inducers Pharmacokinetic studies in humans with oral TREPROSTINIL diolamine indicated that the concomitant administration of CYP2C8 enzyme inducer rifampicin resulted in a reduced (by about 20%) exposure to TREPROSTINIL. In case rifampicin is added to or omitted from the patientâ€™s treatment after the titration phase, a dose adjustment of TREPROSTINIL has to be considered.
> Concomitant administration with BOSENTAN  In a pharmacokinetic study in humans, in which BOSENTAN (250 mg /day) and TREPROSTINIL diolamine (oral dose of 2  mg/day) were administered concomitantly, no pharmacokinetic interac tion between TREPROSTINIL and BOSENTAN was observed.
> Concomitant administration with SILDENAFIL  In a pharmacokinetic study in humans, in which SILDENAFIL (60mg/day) and TREPROSTINIL diolamine (oral dose of 2 mg/day) were administered concomitantly, no pharmacokinetic interaction between TREPROSTINIL and SILDENAFIL was observed.
