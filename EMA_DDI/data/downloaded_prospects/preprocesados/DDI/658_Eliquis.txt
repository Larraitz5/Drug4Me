> Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P -gp Coadministration of apixaban with KETOCONAZOLE (400 mg once a day), a strong inhibitor of both CYP3A4 and P -gp, led to a 2-fold increase in mean apixaban AUC and a 1.6 -fold increase in mean apixaban C max.
> The use of apixaban is not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P -gp, such as azole-antimycotics (e.g., KETOCONAZOLE, ITRACONAZOLE, VORICONAZOLE and POSACONAZOLE) and HIV PROTEASE INHIBITORS (e.g., RITONAVIR) (see section  4.4).
> Active substances which are not considered strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P -gp, (e .g., AMIODARONE, CLARITHROMYCIN, DILTIAZEM, FLUCONAZOLE, NAPROXEN, QUINIDINE, VERAPAMIL) are expected to increase apixaban plasma concentration to a lesser extent. No dose adjustment for apixaban is required when coadministered with agents that are not stro ng inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P -gp. For example, DILTIAZEM (360  mg once a day), considered a moderate CYP3A4 and a weak P -gp inhibitor, led to a 1.4 -fold increase in mean apixaban AUC and a 1.3 -fold increase in Cmax. NAPROXEN (500 mg, single dose) an in hibitor of P -gp but not an inhibitor of CYP3A4, led to a 1.5-fold and 1.6-fold increase in mean apixaban AUC and C max, respectively. CLARITHROMYCIN (500  mg, twice a day), an inhibitor of P -gp and a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, led to a 1.6-fold and 1.3-fold  increase in mean apixaban AUC and C max respectively. 
> Coadministration of apixaban with rifampicin, a strong inducer of both CYP3A4 and P -gp, led to an approximate 54% and 42% decrease in mean apixaban AUC and Cmax, respectively. The concomitant use of apixaban with other strong CYP3A4 and P -gp inducers (e.g., PHENYTOIN, CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENOBARBITAL or St. John’s Wort) may also lead to reduced apixaban plasma concentrations. No dose adjustment for apixaban is required during concomitant therapy with such medicinal products, however in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with strong inducers of both CYP3A4 and P -gp apixaban should be used with caution for the prevention of VTE in elective hip or knee replacement surgery, for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF and for the prevention of recurrent DVT and PE. 
> Apixaban coadministered with CLOPIDOGREL (75 mg once a day) or with the combination of CLOPIDOGREL 
75 mg and ASA 162 mg once dail y, or with PRASUGREL (60 mg followed by 10 mg once daily) in Phase I studies did not show a relevant increase in template bleeding time, or further inhibition of 11 platelet aggregation, compared to administration of the antiplatelet agents without apixaban. Increases in clotting tests (PT, INR, and a
> NAPROXEN (500 mg), an inhibitor of P -gp, led to a 1.5- fold and 1.6-fold increase in mean apixaban AUC and Cmax, respectively. Corresponding increases in clotting tests were observed for apixaban. No changes were observed in the effect of NAPROXEN on arachidonic acid -induced platelet aggregation and no clinically relevant prolongation of bleeding time was observed after concomitant administration of apixaban and NAPROXEN. 
> There is limited experience of co -administration with other platelet aggregation inhibitors (such as GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonists, DIPYRIDAMOLE, DEXTRAN or SULFINPYRAZONE) or thrombolytic agents. As such agents increase the bleeding risk, co -administration of these medicinal products with apixaban is not recommended (see section  4.4).
> No clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when apixaban was coadministered with ATENOLOL or FAMOTIDINE. Coadministration of apixaban 10 mg with ATENOLOL 100 mg did not have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of apixaba n. Following administration of the two medicinal products together, mean apixaban AUC and Cmax were 
15% and 18% lower than when administered alone. The administration of apixaban 10 mg with FAMOTIDINE 40  mg had no effect on apixaban AUC or C max.
