> CYP3A4 i nhibitors  The effect of ITRACONAZOLE (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of MITAPIVAT was evaluated in a Phase  1 study. ITRACONAZOLE increased MITAPIVAT AUC
0-t, AUC ∞ and C max by 4.7- fold, 4.9- fold and 1.7- fold, respectively. Increased MITAPIVAT plasma exposures may increase the risk of insomnia. The concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors with PYRUKYND should be avoided (see section  4.4). If concomitant use of a CYP3A4 inhibitor is unavoidable, patients  should be monitored  for increased risk of insomnia  (see section  4.2).
> CYP3A4 i nducers  The effect of rifampicin (a strong CYP3A4 inducer) on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of MITAPIVAT was evaluated in a Phase  1 study. Rifampicin decreased MITAPIVAT AUC
0-t, AUC ∞ and C max by 91%, 91% and 77%, respectively. Decreased MITAPIVAT plasma exposures  may reduce the efficacy of PYRUKYND. The c oncomitant  use of CYP3A4 inducers with PYRUKYND should be avoided (see section  4.4). If concomitant use of a CYP3A4 inducer is unavoidable, patients should be monitored for reduced efficacy of MITAPIVAT. 
> H -dependent solubility (see section 5.2) and coadministration with gastric acid-reducing agents (e.g. FAMOTIDINE ) may decrease MITAPIVAT absorption (see section  4.4). Concomitant use  of PYRUKYND with medicinal products  that elevate gastric p
> H was not evaluated  in a clinical  drug -drug interaction study. If concomitant use of gastric acid -reducing agents is unavoidable, patients should be monitored for reduced efficacy of MITAPIVAT. 
> CYP3A4 substrates  MITAPIVAT induce s and may inhibit CYP3A4 (see section  5.2) and co- administration with sensitive CYP3A4 substrates  (e.g. MIDAZOLAM)  may alter systemic exposure of these medicinal products . Concomitant use of PYRUKYND with substrates of this enzyme was not evaluated in a clinical drug- drug interaction s tudy. A lternative therapies that are not sensitive substrates of CYP3A4 should be considered during treatment with PYRUKYND (see section  4.4). If co -administrati on of PYRUKYND with sensitive CYP3A4 substrates is unavoidable, patients  should be carefully monitored  especially for those substrates with a narrow therapeutic index  (e.g. ALFENTANIL,  CARBAMAZEPINE , CYCLOSPORINE, ERGOTAMINE , FENTANYL, PIMOZIDE, QUINIDINE , SIROLIMUS , TACROLIMUS) .
> UGT1A1 , CYP2B6  and CYP2C  substrates  Based on in vitro  data, MITAPIVAT may induce UGT 1A1, CYP2B6, CYP2C8 , CYP2C9  and CYP2C19 (see section  5.2) and may decrease systemic exposure to substrates of these ENZYMES  (e.g. IRINOTECAN 
[UGT1A1] ; BUPROPION [CYP2B6]; OMEPRAZOLE [CYP2C19]; REPAGLINIDE [CYP2C8]; WARFARIN 
[CYP2C9] ). Concomitant use of PYRUKYND with substrates of these enzyme s was not evaluated in a clinical  drug -drug interaction study. Alternative therapies that are not UGT1A1 substrates or sen sitive substrates of CYP2B6 or CYP2C  should be considered during treatment with PYRUKYND (see section  4.4). If co- administration is unavoidable, patients should be monitored for loss of therapeutic effect of substates of these ENZYMES, especially for those with a narrow therapeutic index  (e.g. IRINOTECAN [UGT1A1] ; CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE  [CYP2B6]; VALPROIC ACID  [CYP2C19];  PACLITAXEL  
[CYP2C8];  WARFARIN , PHENYTOIN  [CYP2C9] ).
> 7 P-gp substrates  Based on in vitro data, MITAPIVAT may induce  and inhibit  P-gp (see section  5.2) and may alter systemic exposure  of substrates (e.g. DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE) of this transporter.  Concomitant use of PYRUKYND with substrates of P -gp was not evaluated in a clinical drug- drug interaction study. Alternative therapies that ar e not P -gp substrates should be considered during treatment with PYRUKYND (see section 4.4). If co-administration of PYRUKYND with P -gp substrates is unavoidable, patients should be carefully monitored especially for those substrates with a narrow therapeu tic index  (e.g. COLCHICINE , DIGOXIN) .
