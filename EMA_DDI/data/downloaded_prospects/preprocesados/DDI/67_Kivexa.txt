> ABACAVIR is metaboli sed by UDP -glucuronyltransferase (UGT) ENZYMES and alcohol dehydrogenase; co-administration of inducers or inhibitors of UGT ENZYMES or with compounds eliminated through alcohol dehydrogenase could alter ABACAVIR exposure. LAMIVUDINE is cleared renally. Active renal secretion of LAMIVUDINE  in the urine is mediated through organic cation transporters (OCTs); co-administration of LAMIVUDINE with OCT inhibitors may increase LAMIVUDINE exposure.

> In vitro  LAMIVUDINE inhibits the intracellular phosphorylation of CLADRIBINE leading to a potential risk of CLADRIBINE loss of efficacy in case of combination in the clinical setting. Some clinical findings also support a possible interaction between LAMIVUDINE an d CLADRIBINE  Therefore, t he concomitant use of lamivu dine with CLADRIBINE is not recommended (see section 4.4).
