> LENACAPAVIR is a substrate of CYP3A, P -gp and UGT1A1. Strong inducers of CYP3A, P -gp, and UGT1A1, such as rifampicin, may significantly decrease plasma concentrations of LENACAPAVIR  resulting in loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance , therefore co -administration is contraindicated (s ee section  4.3). Moderate inducers of CYP3A and P -gp, such as EFAVIRENZ, may also significantly decrease plasma concentrations of LENACAPAVIR, therefore co -administration is not recommended (see section  4.4).
> Strong inhibitors of CYP3A, P -gp and UGT1A1 together (i.e., all 3 pathways), such as ATAZANAVIR/COBICISTAT, may significantly increase plasma concentrations of LENACAPAVIR, therefore co-administration is not recommended (see section 4.4).
> Strong CY P3A4 inhibitors alone (e.g. VORICONAZOLE) or strong i nhibitors of CYP3A4 and P -gp together (e.g. COBICISTAT) do not result in a clinically meaningful increase in LENACAPAVIR exposures.
