> Efavirenz is an in vivo inducer of  CYP3A4, CYP2B
6 and UGT1A1.  Compounds that are substrates ofthese ENZYMES may have decreased plasma concentrations when co-administ ered with ef avirenz.  Invitro efavirenz is also an inhibitor of
 CYP3A4. Theoretically, efavirenz may theref ore
 initiallyincrease the exposure to CYP3A 4 substrates and caution is warranted f or CYP3A4 substrates withnarro w therapeutic index (see section  4.3). Ef avirenz may be
 an induce r of CYP2C19  and CYP2C9;however inhibition has also been observed in vitro  and the net ef f ect of co-adminis tration withsubstrates of these ENZYMES is not clear (see section
 5.2).Ef avirenz  exposure may be increased when given with medicinal pr oducts (f o r example, RITONAVIR) orf ood (f or example, GRAPEFRUIT JUICE), which inhibit CYP
3A4 or CYP2B 6 activity.Com pound s or herbal preparations (for example GINKGO BILOBA
 extracts a nd St. John’s  wort) whichinduce these ENZYMES may g ive rise to decreased plasma concentrations of efavirenz
. Concomitant useof St. John’s wort is contraindicat ed (see section 4.3). Concom itant use of GINKGO BILOBA  extracts isnot recommended (see
 section 4.4).Co-admin istration of ef avirenz with METAMIZOLE, which
 is an inducer of metabolising e nzymesincluding CYP2B6 and CYP3A4
, may cause a reduction in plasma conce ntrations of ef avirenz withpotential decrease in clinical ef ficacy. Therefore, caution is
 advised when METAMIZOLE and ef avirenzare administered concurrently; clinical response and/o r drug levels should be monitored asappropriate.8QT Prolonging Drugs
> Ef avirenz is contraindicated with concomitant use of drugs (they may cause prolonged QTc in tervaland Torsa de de Pointes) such as: a ntiarrhythmic s of classes IA and III, neuroleptics and antidepressantagents, certain ANTIBIOTICS including some agents of  the following classes: MACROLIDES,f luoroquinolones, imidazole, and triazole antif ungal
 agents, certain non
-sedating antihi staminics(TERFENADINE, ASTEMIZOLE), CISAPRIDE, f lecainide, certain ANTIMALARIALS and METHADONE (see section  4.3).Paediatric population
> Ef avire nz must not be administer ed concurrently with terf enadine,
 astemiz ole, CISAPRIDE, MIDAZOLAM,TRIAZOLAM, PIMOZIDE, BEPRIDIL, or ERGOT ALKALOIDS (for example, ERGOTAMINE, DIHYDROERGOTAMINE,ERGONOVINE, and METHYLERGONOVINE) since inhibition of  their metabolism may lead to serious,life-threatening events (see  section 4.3).Efavirenz must not be administered with
 ELBASVIR/GRAZOPREVIR due to the expected significant decreasesin ELBASVIR and GRAZOPREVIR plasma concentrations caused by  induction  of drug metabolising enzymesand/or tran sport proteins and which are  expected to result in the loss of virologic response ofelbasvir/GRAZOPREVIR (see section 4
.5).St. John’s wort ( Hype ricum perforatum
)Co-administration of efavirenz and St.  John’ s wort or herbal preparations containing St.  John’s wort iscontraindicated. Plasma levels of ef avirenz can be reduced by concomitant use of ST. JOHN'S WORT dueto induct ion of drug metabolising ENZYMES and/or transport proteins by ST. JOHN'S WORT. If  a pa tient isalready taking St. John’s w ort, stop St. John’s wort, check viral levels and if possible efavirenz levels.Ef avirenz levels may increase on stopping St.  John’s w ort and the dose of  ef avirenz may needadjusting.  The inducing eff ect of St. John’s wo rt may persist for at
 least 2 weeks af ter cess ation oftreatmen t (see section  4.3).Praziq uantel
> Concomita nt use with PRAZIQUANTEL is not recommended
 due to significant decrease in plasmaconcentrations of  PRAZIQUANTEL, with risk of treatment f ailure due to increased hepatic metabolism byefavirenz. In case the combination is needed, an increased dose of PRAZIQUANTEL could be considered.Other interactions
