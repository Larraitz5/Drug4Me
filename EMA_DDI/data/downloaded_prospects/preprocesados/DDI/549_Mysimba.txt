> NALTREXONE/BUPROPION is contraindicated in patients currently dependent on chronic opioid or opiate agonist therapy (e.g., METHADONE), or patients in acute opiate withdrawal (see section 4.3). Due to the antagonistic effect of NALTREXONE at the opioid receptor , patients taking NALTREXONE/BUPROPION may not fully benefit from treatment with opioid -containing medicinal products, such as cough and cold remedies, antidiarrhoeal preparations and opioid ANALGESICS. In patients requiring intermittent opiate treatment, na ltrexone/BUPROPION therapy should be temporarily discontinued and opiate dose should not be increased above the standard dose (see section 4.4). If chronic opiate therapy is require d, 9
> CYP2D6 substrates  In a clinical study, NALTREXONE/BUPROPION (32 mg NALTREXONE hydrochloride /360 mg BUPROPION hydrochloride daily) was co- administered with a 50 mg dose of METOPROLOL (a CYP2D6 substrate). NALTREXONE/BUPROPION increased METOPROLOL AUC and C max by approximately 4-  and 2- fold, respectively, relative to METOPROLOL alone. Similar clinical drug interactions resulting in increased pharmacokinetic exposure of CYP2D6 substrates have also been observed with BUPROPION as a single medicinal product with DESIPRAMINE and VENLAFAXINE. 
> Co-administration of BUPROPION with drugs that are metabolised by CYP2D6 isozyme including certain ANTIDEPRESSANTS (SSRIs and many tricyclic ANTIDEPRESSANTS, e.g. DESIPRAMINE, IMIPRAMINE, PAROXETINE), ANTIPSYCHOTICS (e.g., HALOPERIDOL, RISPERIDONE and THIORIDAZINE), beta -blockers (e.g., METOPROLOL) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., PROPAFENONE and FLECAINIDE), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medicinal product. Although citalopr am is not primarily metabolised by CYP2D6, in one study, BUPROPION increased the C max and AUC of CITALOPRAM by 30% and 40%, respectively. 
> Drugs which require metabolic activation by CYP2D6 in order to be effective (e.g., TAMOXIFEN), may have reduced efficacy when administered concomitantly with inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as BUPROPION. If NALTREXONE/BUPROPION is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolised by CYP2D6, the need to decrease the dose of the original medicinal product should be considered, particularly for those concomitant medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic index. When feasible, the opt ion of therapeutic drug monitoring should be considered for medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic index, such as tricyclic  ANTIDEPRESSANTS. 
> Co-administration of medicinal products that may inhibit the metabolism of BUPROPION via CYP2B6 isoenzyme (e.g., CYP2B6 substrates: CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE, IFOSFAMIDE, and CYP2B6 inhibitors: ORPHENADRINE, TICLOPIDINE, CLOPIDOGREL), may result in increased BUPROPION plasma levels and lower 10
> BUPROPION and its metabolites competitively inhibit the OCT2 in the basolateral membrane of the renal tubule responsible for creatinine secretion, in a manner similar to the OCT2 substrate CIMETIDINE. Therefore, mild increases in creatinine observed after long -term treatment with NALTREXONE/BUPROPION are likely due to inhibition of OCT2 and not indicative of changes in creatinine  clearance. Use of NALTREXONE/BUPROPION with other OCT2 substrates (e.g., METFORMIN) in clinical trials did not indicate the need for dose adjustment or other precautions. 
> Caution should be used when prescribing NALTREXONE/BUPROPION to patients with predisposing factors that may increase the risk of seizure including:  
• as treatment with NALTREXONE/BUPROPION may result in lowered GLUCOSE in patients with diabetes, the dose of insulin and/or oral diabetic medicinal products should be assessed to minimise the risk of hypoglycaemia, which could predispose patients to  seizure  
• concomitant administration of medicinal products that may lower the seizure threshold, including ANTIPSYCHOTICS, ANTIDEPRESSANTS, ANTIMALARIALS, TRAMADOL, THEOPHYLLINE, systemic steroids, quinolones and sedating antihistamines 
> NALTREXONE/BUPROPION is contraindicated in patients receiving concomitant treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors, BUPROPION or NALTREXONE, patients undergoing acute alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal, patients currently dependent on chronic OPIOIDS,  or opiate agonists (see section 4.3). 
> Administration of NALTREXONE/BUPROPION to patients receiving either LEVODOPA or AMANTADINE concurrently should be undertaken with caution. Limited clinical data suggest a higher incidence of adverse reactions (e.g., nausea, vomiting, and neuropsychiatric a dverse reactions – see section 4.8) in patients receiving BUPROPION concurrently with either LEVODOPA or AMANTADINE. 
> Coadministration of NALTREXONE/BUPROPION with DIGOXIN may decrease plasma DIGOXIN levels. Monitor plasma DIGOXIN levels in patients treated concomitantly with NALTREXONE/BUPROPION and DIGOXIN.  Clinicians should be aware that DIGOXIN levels may rise on discontinuation of NALTREXONE/BUPROPION and the patient should be monitored for possible DIGOXIN toxicity. 
> BUPROPION plasma concentrations are increased with food and the safety and efficacy data from clinical trials is based on dosing with food.
