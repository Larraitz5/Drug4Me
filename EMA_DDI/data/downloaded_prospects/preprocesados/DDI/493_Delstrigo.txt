> DORAVIRINE is primarily metaboli sed by CYP3A, and medicinal products that induce or inhibit CYP3Aare expected to
 af f ect the clearance of  DORAVIRINE
 (see section  5.2). DORAVIRINE/LAMIVUDINE/tenofovirdisoproxil should not be co
-administered with medicinal products that are strong CYP3A enzymeinducers as signif icant decreases in DORAVIRINE plasma concentrations are expected to occur, whichmay decrease the ef f ectiveness of  DORAVIRINE/LAMIVUDINE/tenof ovir disoproxil
 (see sections
 4.3and 5.2).Co-administration with the moderate CYP3A inducer rif abutin decreased DORAVIRINE concentrations(see Table  1). When DELSTRIGO  is co -administered with rif abutin, a 
100 mg dose of DORAVIRINE shouldbe given  daily, approximately
 12 hours af ter DORAVIRINE/ LAMIVUDINE/tenof ovir disoproxil dose (seesection  4.2).Co-administration of
 DORAVIRINE/LAMIVUDINE/tenof ovir disoproxil with other moderate CYP3A inducershas not been evaluated
, but decreased DORAVIRINE concentrations are expected.  If  co-administrationwith other moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g., debraf enib, LESINURAD, BOSENTAN, THIORIDAZINE, naf cillin,modaf inil, telotristat ethyl)
 cannot be avoided, a 
100 mg dose of  DORAVIRINE should be administereddaily, approximately
 12 hours  af ter the administration of DORAVIRINE/LAMIVUDINE/tenof ovir disoproxildose (see section  4.2).Co-administration of  DORAVIRINE/LAMIVUDINE/TENOFOVIR disproxil
 and medicinal products
 that areinhibitors of CYP3A may result in increased plasma concentrations of  DORAVIRINE. However, no doseadjustment is needed when DORAVIRINE is co
-administered with CYP3A inhibitors.LAMIVUDINE
> Because LAMIVUDINE is primarily eliminated by the kidneys through a combination of glomerularf iltration and active tubular secretion (see section
 5.2), co -administration ofdoravirine/ LAMIVUDINE/ tenof ovir disoproxil  with medicinal products
 that reduce renal f unction orcompete for active tubular secretion may increase serum concentrations of  LAMIVUDINE .TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL
> Because tenof ovir is primarily eliminated by the kidneys through a combination of  glomerularf iltration and active tubular secretion (see section
 5.2), co -administration ofdoravirine/LAMIVUDINE/tenof ovir disoproxil
 with medicinal products that reduce renal f unction orcompete for active tubular secretion via OAT1, OAT3 or MRP4 may increase serum concentrations oftenof o vir.7Due to the tenof ovir disoproxil component of  DORAVIRINE/ LAMIVUDINE/tenof ovir disoproxil , use of  theproduct  should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of  nephrotoxic medicinal products. Someexamples include,  but are not limited to, ACYCLOVIR
, cidof ovir, GANCICLOVIR, valacyclovir, VALGANCICLOVIR,aminoglycosides (e.g., GENTAMICIN), and high
-dose or multiple NSAIDs ( see section  4.4).Ef fects of  DORAVIRINE, LAMIVUDINE
, and tenof ovir  disoproxil  on other medicinal products
> DORAVIRINE at a dose of 100
 mg once daily is not likely to have a clinically relevant eff ect on theplasma concentrations of  medicinal products that are dependent on transport proteins f or absorptionand/or elimination or that are metaboli sed by CYP ENZYMES.However, co
-administration of  DORAVIRINE and the sensitive CYP3A substrate MIDAZOLAM resulted in a
18 
% decrease in MIDAZOLAM exposure, suggesting that DORAVIRINE may be a weak CYP3A inducer.Theref ore, caution should be used when co
-administering DORAVIRINE with medicinal products
 that aresensitive CYP3A substrates that also have a narrow therapeutic window (e.g., tacro limus andsirolimus).LAMIVUDINE
