> RILPIVIRINE is primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A .Medicinal products that induce or inhibit CYP3A may thus affect the clearance of RILPIVIRINE (see section 5.2). Co -administration of RILPIVIRINE and medicinal products that induce CYP3A hasbeen observed to decrease theplasma concentrations of RILPIVIRINE ,which could reduce the therapeutic effect of RILPIVIRINE .Co-administration of RILPIVIRINE and medicinal p roducts that inhibit CYP3A hasbeen observed toincrease the plasma concentrations of RILPIVIRINE .Co-administration of RILPIVIRINE with medicinal products that increase gastric p
> RILPIVIRINE at a dose of 25 mg once daily is not likely to have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure of medicinal products metabolis ed by CYP ENZYMES.Rilpivirin einhibits P -glycoprotein in vitro (IC50is 9.2 μM). In a clinical study ,rilpivirin edid not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of DIGOXIN. However, it may not be completely excluded that rilpivirin ecan increase the ex posure to other medicines transported by P-glycoprotein that are more sensitive to intestinal P -gp inhibition, e.g. DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE.RILPIVIRINE is an in vitro inhibitor of the transporter MATE -2K with an IC50of < 2.7n
