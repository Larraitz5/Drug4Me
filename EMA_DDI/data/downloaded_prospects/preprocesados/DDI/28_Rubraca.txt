> CYP2C9 substrates  RUCAPARIB increased S -WARFARIN C max by 1.05 fold (90% CI: 0.99 to 1.12) and AUC 0-96 h by 1.49 fold (90% CI: 1.40 to 1.58), respectively . When co- administering medicinal products that  are CYP2C9 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., WARFARIN, PHENYTOIN) , dose  adjustments may be considered, if clinically indicated. C aution should be exercised and additional International Normalised Ratio (INR) monitoring with co -administration  of WARFARIN  and therapeutic drug level monitoring of PHENYTOIN should be considered , if used concomitantly with RUCAPARIB. 
> CYP2C19 substrates  RUCAPARIB increased OMEPRAZOLE Cmax by 1.09 fold (90% CI: 0.93 to 1.27) and AUC inf by 1.55 fold (90% CI: 1.32 to 1.83) . The risk for a clinically relevant effect of concomitant administration of PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS ( PPIS) is likely small (see section 5.2). No dose adjustment is considered necessary for co -administered medicinal products that are CYP2C19 substrates. 
> 
6 CYP3A substrates  RUCAPARIB increased MIDAZOLAM C max by 1.13 fold (90% CI: 0.95 to 1.36) and AUC inf by 1.38 fold (90% CI: 1.13 to 1.69). Caution is advised when co- administering medicinal products that are CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., ALFENTANIL, ASTEMIZOLE, CISAPRIDE, CYCLOSPORINE, DIHYDROERGOTAMINE, ERGOTAMINE, FENTANYL, PIMOZIDE, QUINIDINE, SIROLIMUS, TACROLIMUS, TERFENADINE). Dose adjustments may be considered, if clinically indicated based on observed adverse reactions. 
> Oral contraceptives  RUCAPARIB increased ethinylestradiol C max by 1.09 fold (90% CI: 0.94 to 1.27) and AUC last by 1.43 fold (90% CI: 1.15 to 1.77). RUCAPARIB increased lev onorgestrel C max by 1.19 fold (90% CI: 1.00 to 1.42) and AUC last by 1.56 fold (90% CI: 1.33 to 1.83). No dose adjustment is recommended for co-administered oral contraceptives. 
> BCRP substrates  RUCAPARIB increased ROSUVASTATIN C max by 1.29 fold (90% CI: 1.07 to 1.55) and AUC inf by 1.35 fold (90% CI: 1.17 to 1.57). No dose adjustment is recommended for co- administered medicinal products that are BCRP substrates. 
> P-gp substrates  RUCAPARIB showed no effect on Cmax of DIGOXIN while mar ginally increasing AUC 0-72 h by 1.20 fold (90% CI: 1.12 to 1.29). No dose adjustment is recommended for co- administered medicinal products that are P -gp substrates. 
> Interaction of RUCAPARIB with other ENZYMES and transporter was evaluated in vitro . Rucapa rib is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYP2D6, and UGT1A1. RUCAPARIB down regulated CYP2B6 in human hepatocytes at clinically relevant exposures. RUCAPARIB is a potent inhibitor of MATE1 and MATE2 -K, a moderate inhibitor of OCT1, and a weak inhibitor of OCT2. As inhibition of these transporters could decrease METFORMIN renal elimination and decrease liver uptake of METFORMIN, caution is advised when METFORMIN is co- administered  with RUCAPARIB. The clinical relevance of UGT1A1 inhibition by RUCAPARIB is not clear. Caution should be used when RUCAPARIB is co-administered with UGT1A1 substrates (i.e. IRINOTECAN) to patients with UGT1A1*28 (poor metabolizer) due to a possible increase in the  exposur e of SN -38 (the active metabolite of IRINOTECAN)  and associated toxicities.
