> CYP3A/CYP2C8 i nducers  A clinical drug interaction study found that co- administration of a single dose of 300 mg tucatinib with rifampicin (a strong CYP3A and moderate CYP2C8 inducer) resulted in a reduction in tucatinib concentrations (0.6- fold Cmax (90% CI: 0.5, 0.8) and 0.5- fold AUC (90% CI: 0.4, 0.6)). Co-administration of tucatinib with strong CYP3A or moderate CYP2C8 inducers such as rifampicin, PHENYTOIN, ST. JOHN'S WORT, or CARBAMAZEPINE should be avoided as this may result in decreased activi ty of tucatinib (see section  4.4). 
> CYP2C8 i nhibitors  A clinical drug interaction study found that co- administration of a single dose of 300 mg tucatinib with GEMFIBROZIL (a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor) resulted in an increase in tucatinib concentrations (1.6- fold Cmax (90% CI: 1.5, 1.8) and 3.0- fold AUC (90% CI: 2.7, 3.5)). Co- administration of tucatinib with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors such as GEMFIBROZIL should be avoided as this may result in increased risk of tucatinib toxicity (see section  4.4). 
> CYP3A i nhibitors  A clinical drug interaction study found that co- administration of a single dose of 300 mg tucatinib with ITRACONAZOLE (a strong CYP3A inhibitor) resulted in an increase in tucatinib concentrations (1.3- fold Cmax (90% CI: 1.2, 1.4) and 1.3- fold AUC (90% CI: 1.3, 1.4)). No dose adjustment is required. 
> CYP3A substrates  Tucatinib is a strong CYP3A inhibitor. A clinical drug interaction study found that co- administration of tucatinib with MIDAZOLAM (a sensitive CYP3A substrate) resulted in an increase in MIDAZOLAM concentrations (3.0- fold C max (90% CI: 2.6, 3.4) and 5.7- fold AUC (90% CI: 5.0, 6.5)). Co-administration of tucatinib with sensitive CYP3A substrates such as ALFENTANIL, AVANAFIL, BUSPIRONE, DARIFENACIN, DARUNAVIR, EBASTINE, EVEROLIMUS, IBRUTINIB, LOMITAPIDE, LOVASTATIN, MIDAZOLAM, naloxegol, SAQUINAVIR, simvastat in, SIROLIMUS, TACROLIMUS, TIPRANAVIR, TRIAZOLAM, and VARDENAFIL may increase their systemic exposures which may increase the toxicity associated with a CYP3A substrate. Concomitant use of tucatinib with CYP3A substrates, when minimal concentration changes may lead to serious or life-threatening toxicities, should be avoided. If concomitant use is unavoidable, the CYP3A substrate dosage should be decreased in accordance with the concomitant medicinal product Sm
> 8 P-gp substrates  A clinical drug interaction study found that co- administration of tucatinib with DIGOXIN (a sensitive P-gp substrate) resulted in an increase in DIGOXIN concentrations (2.4- fold C max (90% CI: 1.9, 2.9) and 
1.5-fold AUC (90% CI: 1.3, 1.7) ). Concomitant use of tucatinib with a P -gp substrate may increase the plasma concentrations of the P -gp substrate, which may increase the toxicity associated with the P -gp substrate. Dose reduction of P -gp substrates (including sensitive intestinal substrate such as DABIGATRAN) should be considered in accordance with the concomitant medicine Sm
> CYP2C8 substrates  A clinical drug interaction study found that co- administration of tucatinib with REPAGLINIDE (a CYP2C8 substrate) resulted in an increase in REPAGLINIDE concentrations (1.7- fold Cmax (90% CI: 1.4, 2.1) and 
1.7-fold AUC (90% CI: 1.5, 1.9)). No dose adjustment is required. 
> MATE1/2K substrates  A clinical drug interaction study found that co- administration of tucatinib with METFORMIN (a MATE1/2 -K substrate) resulted in an increase in METFORMIN concentrations (1.1- fold C max (90% CI: 
1.0, 1.2) and 1.4- fold AUC (90% CI: 1.2, 1.5)). Tucatinib reduced the renal clearance of METFORMIN without any effect on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as measured by IOHEXOL clearance and serum cystatin C. No dose adjustment is required.
