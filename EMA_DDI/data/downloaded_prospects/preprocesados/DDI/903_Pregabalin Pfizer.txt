> In vivo  studies  and population pharmacokinetic analysis  Accordingly, in in vivo  studies no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between pregabalin and PHENYTOIN, CARBAMAZEPINE, VALPROIC ACID, LAMOTRIGINE, GABAPENTIN, l orazepam, OXYCODONE or ETHANOL. Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that oral ant idiabetics, DIURETICS, insulin, PHENOBARBITAL, TIAGABINE and TOPIRAMATE had no clinically significant effect on pregabalin clearance.  Oral contraceptives, norethisterone and/or ethinyl oestradiol  Co-administration of pregabalin with the oral contraceptives norethisterone and/or ethinyl oestradiol does not influence the steady -state pharmacokinetics of either substance.
