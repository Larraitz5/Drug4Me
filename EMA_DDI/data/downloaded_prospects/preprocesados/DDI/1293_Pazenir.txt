> The metabolism of paclitaxel is catalysed, in part, by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 (see section 5.2). Therefore, in the absence of a PK drug- drug interacti on study, caution should be exercised when administering paclitaxel concomitantly with medicinal products known to inhibit either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 (e.g. KETOCONAZOLE and other imidazole antifungals, ERYTHROMYCIN, FLUOXETINE, GEMFIBROZIL, CLOPIDOGREL, cimet idine, RITONAVIR, SAQUINAVIR, INDINAVIR, and NELFINAVIR) because toxicity of paclitaxel may be increased due to higher paclitaxel exposure. Administering paclitaxel concomitantly with medicines known to induce either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 (e.g. rifampicin, CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENYTOIN, EFAVIRENZ, NEVIRAPINE) is not recommended because efficacy may be compromised because of lower paclitaxel exposures. 
> PAZENIR is indicated as monotherapy for breast cancer, in combination with GEMCITABINE for pancreatic adenocarcinoma, or in combination with CARBOPLATIN for non- small cell lung cancer (see section 4.1). PAZENIR should not be used in combi nation with other anticancer agents.
