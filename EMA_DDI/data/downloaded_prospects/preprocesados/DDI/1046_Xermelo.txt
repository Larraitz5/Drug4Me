> Short acting OCTREOTIDE  Concomitant administration of short -acting OCTREOTIDE with XERMELO  significantly decreased the systemic exposure of telotristat ethyl and telotristat, the active metabolite (see section 5.2).  Short- acting OCTREOTIDE should be administered at least 30 minutes after administration of XERMELO  if treatment with short -acting OCTREOTIDE is needed in combination with XERMELO .
> CYP2B6 substrates  Telotristat induced CYP2B6  in vitro  (see section 5.2) . Concomitant use of XERMELO may decrease the efficacy of medicinal products that are CYP2B6 substrates (e.g. VALPROIC ACID , BUPROPION, SERTRALINE) by decreasing their systemic exposure.  Monitor ing for suboptimal efficacy  is recommended .
> CYP3A4 substrates  Concomitant use of XERMELO may decrease the efficacy of medicinal pr oducts  that are CYP3A4 substrates (e.g. MIDAZOLAM, EVEROLIMUS, SUNITINIB,  SIMVASTATIN, ethiny loestradiol, AMLODIPINE, cyclospori neâ€¦) by decreasing their systemic exposure  (see section 5.2) . Monitor ing for suboptimal efficacy  is recommended .
> Carboxylesterase 2 (CES 2) substrates  Concomitant use of XERMELO  may change the exposure of medicinal products that are CES2 substrates (e.g. PRASUGREL, IRINOTECAN, CAPECITABINE and FLUTAMIDE) (see section 5.2).  If co-administration is unavoidable, monitor for suboptimal efficacy and adverse reactions .
