> The safety and efficacy of concurrent use of lebrikizumab with live and live attenuated VACCINES has not been studied. L ive and live attenuated VACCINES should not be given concurrently with lebrikizumab. 
> P vaccine (T cell -dependent) and a meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (T  cell-independent) and immune responses were assessed 
4 weeks later.  Antibody responses  to both non-live vacci nes were  not negatively impacted  by the concomitant lebrikizumab treatment. No adverse interactions between the non- live VACCINES and lebrikizumab were noted in the study. Therefore, patients receiving lebrikizumab may receive concurrent inactivated or non- live vaccinations. For information on live VACCINES see section 4.4.
