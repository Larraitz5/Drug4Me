>  Concurrent treatment with ANAKINRA 
> Adult patients treated with etanercept  and ANAKINRA were observed to have a higher rate of serious infection when compared with patients treated with either etanercept  or ANAKINRA alone (historical data). 
> In addition, in a double -blind, placebo- controlled trial in adult patients receiving background METHOTREXATE, patients treated with etanercept  and ANAKINRA were observed to have a higher rate of serious infections (7%) and neutropenia than patients treated with etanercept  (see sections 4.4 and 
4.8). The combination etanercept  and ANAKINRA has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit, and is therefore not recommended. 
> Concurrent treatment with ABATACEPT 
> In clinical studies, concurrent administration of ABATACEPT and etanercept  resulted in increased incidences of serious adverse events. This combination has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit; such use is not recommended (see section 4.4). 
> Concurrent treatment with SULFASALAZINE 
> In a clinical study of adult patients who were receiving established doses of SULFASALAZINE, to which etanercept  was added, patients in the combination group experienced a statistically significant decrease in mean white blood cell counts in comparison to groups treated with etanercept  or SULFASALAZINE alone. The clinical significance of this interaction is unknown. Physicians should use caution when considering combination therapy with SULFASALAZINE.
