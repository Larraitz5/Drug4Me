> 4.5 and 5.1). When starting therapy in patients with a documented history of LAMIVUDINE -resistant HBV, combination use of entecavir plus a second antiviral agent (which does not share cross -resistance with either LAMIVUDINE or entecavir) should be consi dered in preference to entecavir monotherapy. 
> Pre-existing LAMIVUDINE -resistant HBV is associated with an increased risk for subsequent entecavir resistance regardless of the degree of liver disease; in patients with decompensated liver disease, virologic  breakthrough may be associated with serious clinical complications of the underlying liver disease. Therefore, in patients with both decompensated liver disease and LAMIVUDINE -resistant HBV, combination use of entecavir plus a second antiviral agent (whic h does not share cross -resistance with either LAMIVUDINE or entecavir) should be considered in preference to entecavir monotherapy. 
> Since entecavir is predominantly eliminated by the kidney (see section 5.2), coadministration with medicinal products that reduce re nal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase serum concentrations of either medicinal product. Apart from LAMIVUDINE, ADEFOVIR DIPIVOXIL and TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL FUMARATE, the effects of coadministration of entecavir with medicinal pro ducts that  7 are excreted renally or affect renal function have not been evaluated. Patients should be monitored closely for adverse reactions when entecavir is coadministered with such medicinal products.
