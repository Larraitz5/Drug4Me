> P inhibitor. If the moderate inhibitor is discontinued , consider a washout period of at least 2 to 3  days (average elimination time for most commonly used moderate inhibitors) before  the VOTUBIA  dose is returned to the dose used prior to initiation of the co-administration.  The everolimus trough concentration should be assessed at least 1  week  later (see section s 4.2 and 4.4) .

GRAPEFRUIT JUICE or other food affecting CYP3A4/Pg
> For patients with renal angiomyolipoma associated with TSC:  If patients require co -administration of a potent CYP3A4 inducer, a VOTUBIA dose increase from 10  mg daily up to 20  mg daily should be considered using 5  mg increments or less applied on Day  4 and 8 following start of the inducer. This dose of VOTUBIA is predicted to adjust the AUC to the range observed without inducers. However, there are no clinical data with this dose adjustment. If treatment with the inducer is discontinued, consider a washout peri od of at least 3 to 5  days (reasonable time for significant enzyme de -induction) before the VOTUBIA dose is returned to the dose used prior to initiation of the co-administration (see also Therapeutic drug monitoring in section  4.2).
> For patients with SEG A associated with TSC:  Patients receiving concomitant potent CYP3A4 inducers may require an increased VOTUBIA dose to achieve the same exposure as patients not taking potent inducers. Dosing should be titrated to attain trough concentrations of 5 to 
15 ng/ml. If concentrations are below 5  ng/ml, the daily dose may be increased by 2.5  mg every 
2 weeks, checking the trough level and assessing tolerability before increasing the dose. 
> DEXAMETHASONE  Not studied. Decreased exposure expected.  ANTIEPILEPTICS (e.g. CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENOBARBITAL, PHENYTOIN)  Not studied. Decreased exposure expected.  EFAVIRENZ, NEVIRAPINE  Not studied. Decreased exposure expected.  14 Discontinuation of one of multiple strong CYP3A4 inducers may not require additional dose adjustment. Assess the everolimus trough level 
2 weeks after discontinuation of one of multiple strong CYP3A4 inducers. If all potent inducers are discontinued, consider a washout period of at least 3 to 5  days (reasonable time for significant enzyme de -induction) before the VOTUBIA dose is returned to the dose used prior to initiation of the co-administration. The everolimus trough concentrations should be assessed 2  to 4 weeks later since the natural degrada tion time of the induced ENZYMES has to be taken into account (see sections  4.2 and 4.4).  St John’s Wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) Not studied. Large decrease in exposure expected.  Preparations containing St John’s Wort should not be used during treatment with everolimus 
> P in the gut cannot be excluded . An interaction study in healthy subjects demonstrated th at co -administration of an oral dose of MIDAZOLAM, a sensitive CYP3A substrate probe, with everolimus resulted in a 25% increase in MIDAZOLAM C max and a 30% increase in MIDAZOLAM AUC (0-inf). The effect is likely to be due to inhibition of intestinal CYP3A4 by everolimus.  Hence everolimus may affect the bioavailability of orally co -administered CYP3A4 substrates. However, a clinically relevant effect on the exposure of systemically administered CYP3A4 substrates is not expected (see section  4.4).
> In EXIST -3 (Study CRAD001M2304), e verolimus increased pre -dose concentrations of the antiepileptic s CARBAMAZEPINE, CLOBAZAM, and the CLOBAZAM metabolite N -desm ethylclobazam by about 
10%. The increase in the pre -dose concentrations of these antiepile ptics  may not be clinically significant but dose adjustments for ANTIEPILEPTICS  with a narrow therapeutic index, e.g CARBAMAZEPINE, may be considered . Everolimus had no impact on pre -dose concentrations of ANTIEPILEPTICS  that are substrates of CYP3A4 (clon azepam, DIAZEPAM, FELBAMATE and ZONISAMIDE). 
> Patients taking concomitant ACE INHIBITOR (e.g. RAMIPRIL) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema (see section  4.4).
