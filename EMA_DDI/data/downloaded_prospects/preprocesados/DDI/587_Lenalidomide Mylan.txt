>  Erythropoietic agents, or other agents t hat may increase the risk of thrombosis, such as hormone replacement therapy, should be used with caution in multiple myeloma patients receiving lenalidomide with DEXAMETHASONE (see sections  4.4 and  4.8). 
>  WARFARIN  Co-administration of multiple 10  mg doses of lenalidomide had no effect on the single dose pharmacokinetics of R - and S - WARFARIN. Co -administration of a single 25  mg dose of WARFARIN had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide. However, it is no t known whether there is an interaction during clinical use (concomitant treatment with DEXAMETHASONE). DEXAMETHASONE is a weak to moderate enzyme inducer and its effect on WARFARIN is unknown. Close monitoring of WARFARIN concentration is advised during t he treatment. 
>  DIGOXIN  Concomitant administration with lenalidomide 10  mg once daily increased the plasma exposure of DIGOXIN (0.5  mg, single dose) by 14% with a 90% CI (confidence interval) [0.52% -28.2%]. It is not known whether the effect will be diff erent in the clinical use (higher lenalidomide doses and concomitant treatment with DEXAMETHASONE). Therefore, monitoring of the DIGOXIN concentration is advised during lenalidomide treatment. 
>  DEXAMETHASONE  Co-administration of single or multiple doses of DEXAMETHASONE (40 mg once daily) has no clinically relevant effect on the multiple dose pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide (25  mg once daily). 
>  Interactions with P -glycoprotein (P -gp) inhibitors   In vitro , lenalidomide is a substrate of P -gp, but is not a P -gp inhibitor . Co-administration of multiple doses of the strong P -gp inhibitor QUINIDINE (600 mg, twice daily) or the moderate P -gp inhibitor/substrate TEMSIROLIMUS (25  mg) has no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide (25  mg). Co -administr ation of lenalidomide does not alter the pharmacokinetics of TEMSIROLIMUS.
