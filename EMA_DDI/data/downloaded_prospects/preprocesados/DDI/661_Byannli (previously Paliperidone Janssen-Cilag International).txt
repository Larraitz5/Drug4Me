> PALIPERIDONE is not exp ected to cause clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions with medicinal products that are metabolised by cytochrome P450 isozymes.Given the primary CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (CNS) effects of PALIPERIDONE (see section 4.8), BYANNLI should be used wit h caution in combination with other centrally acting medicinal products, e.g., ANXIOLYTICS, most ANTIPSYCHOTICS, hypnotics, opiates, etc. or alcohol.PALIPERIDONE may antagonise the effect of LEVODOPA and other DOPAMINE AGONISTS. If this combination is deemed necessary, particularly in end -stage Parkinsonâ€™s disease, the lowest effective dose of each treatment should be prescribed.Because of its potential for inducing orthostatic hypotension (see section 4.4), an additive effect may be observed when BYANN LI is administered with other medicinal products that have this potential, e.g., OTHER ANTIPSYCHOTICS, tricyclics.Caution is advised if PALIPERIDONE is combined with other medicinal products known to lower the seizure threshold (i.e., phenothiazines or b utyrophenones, tricyclics or SSRIs, TRAMADOL, MEFLOQUINE, etc.).Co-administration of oral PALIPERIDONE prolonged -release tablets at steady -state (12 mgonce daily) with DIVALPROEX SODIUM prolonged -release tablets (500 mgto 2000mgonce daily) did not a ffect the steady -state pharmacokinetics of valproate.No interaction study between BYANNLI and LITHIUM has been performed, however, a pharmacokinetic interaction is not likely to occur.Potential for other medicines to affect BYANNLIIn vitro studies in dicate that CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 may be minimally involved in PALIPERIDONE metabolism, but there are no indications in vitro nor in vivo that these isozymes play a significant role in the metabolism of PALIPERIDONE. Concomitant administration of oral paliperi done with PAROXETINE, a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, showed no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of PALIPERIDONE.Co-administration of oral PALIPERIDONE prolonged -release once daily with CARBAMAZEPINE 200 mgtwice daily caused a decrease o f approximately 37% in the mean steady -state C maxand AUC of PALIPERIDONE. This decrease is caused, to a substantial degree, by a 35% increase in renal clearance of PALIPERIDONE likely as a result of induction of renal P -gp by CARBAMAZEPINE. A minor decrea se in the amount of active substance excreted unchanged in the urine suggests that there was little effect on the CYP metabolism or bioavailability of PALIPERIDONE during CARBAMAZEPINE co -administration. Larger decreases in plasma concentrations of paliper idone could occur with higher doses of CARBAMAZEPINE. On initiation of CARBAMAZEPINE, the dose of BYANNLI should be re -evaluated and increased if necessary. Conversely, on discontinuation of CARBAMAZEPINE, the dose of BYANNLI should be re-evaluated and dec reased if necessary. Consideration should be given to the long -acting nature of BYANNLI .Co-administration of a single dose of an oral PALIPERIDONE prolonged -release tablet 12 mgwith DIVALPROEX SODIUM prolonged -release tablets (two 500 mgtablets once da ily) resulted in an increase of approximately 50% in the C max and AUC of PALIPERIDONE, likely as a result of increased oral absorption. Since no effect on the systemic clearance was observed, a clinically significant interaction would not be expected betwe en DIVALPROEX SODIUM prolonged -release tablets and BYANNLI gluteal intramuscular injection. This interaction has not been studied with BYANNLI .11Concomitant use of BYANNLI with RISPERIDONE or oral PALIPERIDONE
> Since PALIPERIDONE is the major active metabo lite of RISPERIDONE, caution should be exercised when BYANNLI is co -administered with RISPERIDONE or with oral PALIPERIDONE for extended periods of time. Safety data involving concomitant use of BYANNLI with OTHER ANTIPSYCHOTICS is limited.Concomitant us e of BYANNLI with psychostimulants
