> Topotecan does not inhibit human P450 ENZYMES (see section 5.2). In a population study using the intravenous route, the co-administration of GRANISETRON, ONDANSETRON, MORPHINE or CORTICOSTEROIDS did not appear to have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of total topotecan (active and inactive form).
> When combining topotecan with other chemotherapy agents, reduction of the doses of each medicinal product may be required to improve tolerability. However, when combining with PLATINUM agents, there is a distinct sequence-dependent interaction depending on whether the PLATINUM agent is given on day 1 or 5 of the topotecan dosing. If either CISPLATIN or CARBOPLATIN is given on day 1 of the topotecan dosing, a lower dose of each agent must be given to improve tolerability compared to the dose of each agent which can be given if the PLATINUM agent is given on day 5 of the topotecan dosing.
> When topotecan (0.75 mg/m2/day for 5 consecutive days) and CISPLATIN (60 mg/m2/day on day 1) were administered in 13 patients with ovarian cancer, a slight increase in AUC (12%, n = 9) and C max (23%, n = 11) was noted on day 5. This increase is considered unlikely to be of clinical relevance.
