> In a clinical trial in which ZEVALIN was administered as consolidation after prior first line chemotherapy, a higher frequency of severe and prolonged neutropenia and thrombocytopenia was observed in patients who had received ZEVALIN within 4 months after a combination chemotherapy of FLUDARABINE with MITOXANTRONE and/or CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE compared to those patients who had received any other chemotherapy. Hence the risk of haematological toxicity may be increased when ZEVALIN is administered shortly (< 4 months) after FLUDARABINE-containing regimens (see also section 4.4).
