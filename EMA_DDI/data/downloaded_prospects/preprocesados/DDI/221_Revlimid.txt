> UWarfarin Co-administration of multiple  10 mg doses of lenalidomide had no effect on the single dose pharmacokinetics of R- and S - WARFARIN. Co -administration of a single 25  mg dose of WARFARIN had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide. However, it is not known whether there is an interaction during clinical use (concomitant treatment with DEXAMETHASONE). DEXAMETHASONE is a weak to moderate enzyme inducer and its effect on WARFARIN is unknown. Close monitoring of WARFARIN concentration is advised during the treatment. 
> UDigoxin  Concomitant administration with lenalidomide 10  mg once daily  increased the plasma exposure of DIGOXIN (0.5 mg, single dose) by 14% with a 90% CI (confidence interval) [0.52% -28.2%]. It is not known whether the effect will be different in the clinical use (higher lenalidomide doses and concomitant treatment with DEXAMETHASONE). Therefore, monitoring of the DIGOXIN concentration is advised during lenalidomide treatment. 
> UDexamethasone Co-administration of single or multiple doses of DEXAMETHASONE (40 mg  once da ily) has no clinically relevant effect on the multiple dose pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide (25 mg once daily ).
> UInteractions with  P-glycoprotein (P -gp) inhibitors  In vitro , lenalidomide is a substrate of P -gp, but is not a P-gp inhibitor. Co-administration of multiple doses of the  strong P-gp inhibitor QUINIDINE (600 mg, twice daily) or the moderate P -gp inhibitor/substrate TEMSIROLIMUS (25 mg) has no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide (25  mg). Co-administration of lenalidomide  does not alter the pharmacokinetics of TEMSIROLIMUS.
