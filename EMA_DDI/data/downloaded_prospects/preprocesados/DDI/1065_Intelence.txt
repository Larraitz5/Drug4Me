> Etravirine is metabolised by CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 followed by glucuronidation of the metabolites by URIDINE diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (UDPGT). M edicinal products that 7induce CYP3A4, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 may increase the clearance of etravirine, resulting in lowered plasma concentrations of etravirine.Co-administration of etravirine and medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A4, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 may decrease the clearance of etravirine and may result in increased plasma concentrations of etravirine.Medicinal products that are affected by the use of etravirine
> Com bining two NNRTIs has not been shown to be beneficial. Concomitant use of etravirine with EFAVIRENZ or NEVIRAPINE may cause a significant decrease in the plasma concentration of etravirine and loss of therapeutic effect of etravirine .Concomitant use of etravirine with RILPIVIRINE may cause a decrease in the plasma concentration of RILPIVIRINE and loss of therapeutic effect of RILPIVIRINE.It is not recommended to co-administer INTELENCE with other NNRTIs.HIV Protease I nhibitors ( PIs)–Unboosted (i.e. without co -administration of low -dose RITONAVIR)INDINAVIR Concomitant use of etravirine with INDINAVIR may cause a significant decrease in the plasma concentration of INDINAVIR and loss of therapeutic effect of INDINAVIR .It is not recommended to co-administer INTELENCE with INDINAVIR.HIV P Is –Boosted with low -dose RITONAVIR
> Not studied. Co-administration of etravirinewith ATAZANAVIR/c obicistat or DARUNAVIR/COBICISTAT may decrease plasma concentrations of the PI and/or COBICISTAT, which may result in loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance.Co-administration of INTELENCE w ith ATAZANAVIR/COBICISTAT or DARUNAVIR/cobicist at is not recommended.CCR5 Antagonists
> Etravirine significantly reduced plasma concentrations of DOLUTEGRAVIR. The effect of etravirine on DOLUTEGRAVIR plasma concentrations was mitigated by co-administration of DARUNAVIR/RITONAVIR or LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR, and isexpected to be mitigated by ATAZANAVIR/RITONAVIR.INTELENCE should only be used with DOLUTEGRAVIR when co-administered with ATAZANAVIR/RITONAVIR,DARUNAVIR/RITONAVIR, or LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR. This combination can be used without dose adjustment.Raltegrav ir

> Not studied. INTELENCE is expected to decrease plasma concentrations of these antiarrhythmics.Caution is warranted and therapeutic concentration monitoring, if available, is recommended for antiarrhythmics when co-administered with INTELENCE.ANTIBIOTICSAzithromycin Not studied. Based on the biliary elimination pathway of AZITHROMYCIN, no drug interactions are expected betw een AZITHROMYCIN and INTELENCE.INTELENCE and AZITHROMYCIN can be us ed without dose adjustments.11Clarithromycin

> AUC ↑ 1.42 (1.34 -1.50)Cmin ↑ 1.46 (1.36 -1.58)Cmax ↑ 1.46 (1.38 -1.56)CLARITHROMYCIN exposure was decreased by etravirine; however, concentrations of the active metabolite, 
14-OH-CLARITHROMYCIN, were increased. Because 
14-OH-CLARITHROMYCIN has reduced activi ty against Mycobacterium aviumcomplex (MAC), overall activity against this pathogen may be altered; therefore alternatives to CLARITHROMYCIN should be considered for the treatment of MAC.ANTICOAGULANTSWarfarin Not studied. Etravirine is expected to in crease plasma concentrations of WARFARIN.It is recommended that the international normalised ratio (INR) be monitored when WARFARIN is combined with INTELENCE.ANTICONVULSANTSCarbamazepine
> Not studied. Carbazamepine, phenobarbit al and PHENYTOIN are expected to decrease plasma concentrations of etravirine.Com bination not recommended.ANTIFUNGALSFluconazole

> Not studied. POSACONAZOLE , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, may increase plasma conce ntrations of etravirine. ITRACONAZOLE and KETOCONAZOLE are potent inhibitors as well as substrates of CYP3A4. Concomitant systemic use of ITRACONAZOLE or KETOCONAZOLE and etravirine may increase plasma concentrations of etravirine. Simultaneously, plasma c oncentrations of ITRACONAZOLE or KETOCONAZOLE may be decreased by etravirine .INTELENCE and these antifungals can be used without dose adjustments.VORICONAZOLE

> AUC ↔ 1.10 (1.06 -1.15)Cmin ↔ 1.08 (1.04 -1.14)Cmax↔ 1.11 (1.06 -1.17)Close monitoring of antimalarial response is warranted when co-administering INTELENCE and ARTEMETHER/LUMEFANTRINE as a significant decrease in exposure of ARTEMETHER and its active metabolite, dihydroartemisinin, may result in decreased antimalarial efficacy. No dose adjustment is needed for INTELENCE.ANTIMYCOBACTERIALSRifampicin
> Not studied. Rifampicin a nd RIFAPENTINE are expected to decrease plasma concentrations of etravirine.INTELENCE should be used in combination with a boosted PI. Rifampicin is contraindicated in combination with boosted P is.Com bination not recommended.RIFABUTIN

> With an associated boosted PI:No interaction study has been performed. Based on historical data, a decrease in etravirine exposure may be expected whereas an increase in RIFABUTIN exposure and especially in 
25-O-desacetyl -RIFABUTIN may be expected.With no associated boosted PI (out of the recommended indication for etravirine):RIFABUTIN
> AUC ↓ 0.63 (0.54 -0.74)Cmin ↓ 0.65 (0.56 -0.74)Cmax↓ 0.63 (0.53 -0.74)The com bination of INTELENCE w ith a boosted PI and RIFABUTIN should be used with caution due to the risk of decrease in etravirine exposure and the risk of increase in RIFABUTIN and 
25-O-desacetyl -RIFABUTIN exposures.Close monitoring for virologic response and f or RIFABUTIN related adverse reactions is recommended.Please refer to the product information of the associated boosted PI for the dose adjustment of RIFABUTIN to be used.BENZODIAZEPINESDiazepam Not studied. Etravirine is expected to increase plasma c oncentrations of DIAZEPAM.Alternatives to DIAZEPAM should be considered.CORTICOSTEROIDSDexamethasone (systemic)Not studied. DEXAMETHASONE is expected to decrease plasma concentrations of etravirine
> The combination of oestrogen -and/or PROGESTERONE -based contracept ives and INTELENCE can be used without dose adjustment.HEPATITIS C VIRUS (HCV) DIRECT -ACTING ANTIVIRALSRibavirin Not studied, but no interaction expected based on the renal elimination pathway of RIBAVIRIN.The combination of INTELENCE and RIBAVIRIN can be used without dose adjustments.DACLATASVIR Not studied. Co-administration of etravirinewith DACLATASVIR may decrease DACLATASVIR concentrations. Co-administration of INTELENCE anddaclatasvir is not recommended.ELBASVIR/GRAZOPREVIR Not studied. Co-administration of etravirinewith ELBASVIR/GRAZOPREVIR may decrease ELBASVIR and GRAZOPREVIR concentrations, leading to reduced therapeutic effect of ELBASVIR/GRAZOPREVIR.Co-administration is contraindicated (see section 4.3).HERBAL PRODUCTSSt
> AUC ↔ 1.02 (0.97 -1.07)Cmin ↔ 1.10 (1.02 -1.19)Cmax↔ 0.97 (0.93 -1.02)The combination of INTELENCE and ATORVASTATIN can be given without any dose adjustments, however, the dose of ATORVASTATIN may need to be altered based on clinical response.FLUVASTATIN
> Not studied. No interaction betw een pravastatinand etravirine is expected.LOVASTATIN , ROSUVASTATIN and SIMVASTATIN are CYP3A4 substrates and co -administration with etravirine may result in lower plasma concentrations of the HMG Co-A reductase inhibitor. FLUVASTATIN , and ROSUVASTATIN are metabolised by CYP2C9 and co -administration with etravirine may result in higher plasma concentrations of the HMG Co-A reductase inhibitor.Dose adjustments for these HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors may be necessary.H2-RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTSRanitidine

> Not studied. Etravirine is expected to decrease plasma concentrati ons of CYCLOSPORINE, SIROLIMUS and TACROLIMUS.Co-administration with systemic IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS should be done w ith caution because plasma concentrations of cyclosporin, SIROLIMUS and TACROLIMUS may be affected when co -administered w ith INTELENCE.NARCO TIC ANALGESICSMethadoneindividual dose ranging from 6 0mg to 13 0mg once daily

> AUC ↓ 0.59 (0.52 -0.68)Cmin NDCmax↓ 0.75 (0.59 -0.96)Concomitant use of PDE -5 inhibitors with INTELENCE may require dose adjustment of the PDE -5 inhibitor to attain the desired clinical effect.PLATELET AGGREGGATION INHIBITORSClopidogrel In vitro data show  that etravirine has inhibitory properties on CYP2C19. It is therefore possible that etravirine may inhibit the metabolism of CLOPIDOGREL to its active metabolite by such inhibition of CYP2C19 in vivo . The clinical relevance of this interaction has not beendemonstrated.As a precaution it is recommended that concomitant use of etravirine and CLOPIDOGREL should be discouraged.PROTON PUMP INHIBITORSOmeprazole
