> CYP3A4 i nhibitors  Co-administration of moderate (DILTIAZEM)  and strong (POSACONAZOLE) CYP3A4 inhibitors with single doses of encorafenib in healthy volunteers  resulted in a 2 and 3- fold increase in  the area under the concentration -time curve ( AUC ), respectively and in 44.6%  and 68.3% increase in maximum encorafenib concentration ( Cmax) respectively.   Model  based predictions indicate that the effect of POSACONAZOLE after repeated administrations could be similar for AUC (3 -fold increase) and slightly greater for C max (2.7- fold increase). Model -based predictions for KETOCONAZOLE suggest an increase of approx. 5- fold for encorafenib AUC and 3 to 4-fold for encorafenib C max after administration of encorafenib 450 and 300 mg QD, respectively . Therefore, c oncomitant administration of encorafenib with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided (due to increased encorafenib exposure and potential increase in toxicity , see section  5.2). Examples of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include, but are not limited to, RITONAVIR, ITRACONAZOLE, CLARITHROMYCIN, TELITHROMYCIN, POSACONAZOLE and GRAPEFRUIT JUICE. If concomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor is unavoidable, patients should be carefully monitored for safety. Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors should be co- administered with caution. Examples of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors include, but are not limited to, AMIODARONE, ERYTHROMYCIN, FLUCONAZOLE, DILTIAZEM, AMPRENAVIR and IMATINIB. When encorafenib is co -administered with a moderate CYP3A inhibitor, patients should be carefully monitored for safety. 
> CYP3A4 i nducers  Co-administration of encorafenib with a strong CYP3A4 inducer was not assessed in a clinical study; however , a reduction in encorafenib exposure is likely and may result in compromised efficacy of encorafenib . Examples of strong CYP3A4 inducers include, but are not limited to CARBAMAZEPINE, rifampicin, PHENYTOIN and St. Johnâ€™s Wort. Alternative agents with no to moderate CYP3A induction potential  should be considered. 
> PC.   Encorafenib is an inhibitor of UGT1A1. Concomitant a gents that are substrates of UGT1A1 ( e.g. RALTEGRAVIR, ATORVASTATIN, DOLUTEGRAVIR)  may have increased exposure and should be  therefore  administered with caution. 
> Transporter s ubstrates  In vivo , encorafenib is a n inhibitor of OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and/or BCRP. Coadministration of encorafenib with OATP1B1, OATP1B3 or BCRP substrates (such as ROSUVASTATIN, ATORVASTATIN, METHOTREXATE) can result in increased concentrations (see section 5.2) . In vitro , encorafenib potentially inhibits a number of other transporters. Agents that are substrates of renal transporters  OAT1, OAT3, OCT2 (such as FUROSEMIDE, penicillin) or agents that are substrates of the h epatic transporters OCT1  (such as,  BOSENTAN)  or substrates of P -gp (e.g. POSACONAZOLE) may also have increased exposure.  Therefore , these agents , substrates of transporters should be co- administered with caution.
