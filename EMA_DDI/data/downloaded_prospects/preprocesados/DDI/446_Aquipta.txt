> Strong CYP3A4 i nhibitors (e.g., KETOCONAZOLE, ITRACONAZOLE, clarithromyci n, RITONAVIR) can significantly increase systemic exposure to atogepant . Co-administration of atogepant with ITRACONAZOLE resulted in increase dexposure (Cmax by 2.15 -fold and AUC by 5.5 -fold) of atogepant in healthy subjects (seesection 4.2).Changes in atogepant exposure when co -administered with weak or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors are not expected to be clinically significant.Transporter inhibitors
> Organic anion transporting polypeptide ( OATP )inhibitor s (e.g., rifampicin, CICLOSPORIN , RITONAVIR )can significantly increase systemic exposure to atogepant . Co-administration of atogepant with single dose rifampi cin resulted in increase dexposur e (Cmax by 2.23 -fold an d AUC by 2.85 -fold)of atogepant in healthy subjects (see section 4.2) .Frequently co -administered medicinal products
> Co-administration of atogepant with oral contraceptive components ETHINYL ESTRADIOL and LEVONORGESTREL, paracetamol, NAPROXEN, sumatrip tan, or UBROGEPANT did not result in significant pharmacokinetic interactions for either atogepant or co -administered medicinal products .Co-administration with FAMOTIDINE oresomeprazole did not result in clinically relevant changes of atogepant exposure.
