> Co-treatment with potent CYP3A inhibitors such as KETOCONAZOLE, RITONAVIR, ITRACONAZOLE, CLARITHROMYCIN, COBICISTAT and GRAPEFRUIT JUICE may cause a marked increase of the plasma concentration of budesonide and is  expected to increase the risk of systemic adverse reactions . Therefore, concomitant use should be avoided unless the benefit outweighs the increased risk of systemic corticosteroid adverse reaction s, in which case patients should be monitored for systemic corticosteroid adverse reaction s. 
> Ketoco nazole 200 mg once daily orally  increased the plasma concentration of budesonide (3 mg single dose) approximately 6-fold during concomitant administration. When KETOCONAZOLE was administered approximately 12 hours after budesonide, the plasma concentr ation  of budesonide  increased approximately 3-fold.
