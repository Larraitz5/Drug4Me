> Alpha adrenergic agonists (e. g. BRIMONIDINE TARTRATE), as a class, may reduce pulse and blood pressure. Following administration of SIMBRINZA, small decreases in blood pressure were observed in some patients. Caution is advised when using medicinal products such as ANTIHYPERTENSIVES a nd/or cardiac glycoside s concomitantly with SIMBRINZA. 
> Caution is advised when initiating (or changing the dose of) concomitant systemic medicinal products (irrespective of pharmaceutical form) which may interact with Î± -adrenergic agonists or interfere wi th their activity , i.e. agonists or antagonists of the adrenergic receptor (e.g. isoprenaline, PRAZOSIN). 
> There is a potential for an additive effect on the known systemic effects of carbonic anhydrase inhibition in patients receiving an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and topical BRINZOLAMIDE. The concomitant administration of SIMBRINZA and oral carb onic anhydrase inhibitors is not recommended.
