> Co-administration of pantoprazole is contraindicated with HIV PROTEASE INHIBITORS for which absorption is dependent on acidic intragastric p
> Although no interaction during concomitant administration of PHENPROCOUMON or WARFARIN has been observed in clinical pharmacokinetic studies, a few isolated cases of changes in International Normalised Ratio (INR) have been reported during concomitant treatment in the post -marketing period. Therefore, in patients treated with COUMARIN anticoagulants (e.g., PHENPROCOUMON or WARFARIN), monitoring of prothrombin time/INR is recommended after initiation, termination o r during irregular use of pantoprazole. 
> Concomitant use of high- dose METHOTREXATE (e.g ., 300 mg) and PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS has been reported to increase METHOTREXATE levels in some patients. Therefore , in settings where high -dose METHOTREXATE is used, for example cancer and psoriasis, a temporary withdrawal of pantoprazole may need to be considered.
