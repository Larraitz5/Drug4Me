> In vitro studies  SILDENAFIL metabolism is principally mediated by the cytochrome  P450  (CYP) isoforms 3A4 (major  route) and 2C9 (minor route). Therefore, inhibitors of these isoenzymes may reduce SILDENAFIL  clearance and inducers of these isoenzymes may increase SILDENAFIL clearance. For dose  recommendations, see secti ons 4.2 and 4.3.
> In vivo studies  Co-administration of oral SILDENAFIL and intravenous epoprostenol h as been evaluated (see sections  4.8 and 5.1). 
> Population pharmacokinetic analysis of pulmonary arterial hypertension clinical study  data indicated a  reduction in SILDENAFIL clearance and/or an increase of oral bioavailability when co -administered with  CYP3A4 substrates and the combination of CYP3A4 substrates and beta -blockers. These were the  only factors with a statistically significant impact on SILDENAFIL pharmacokinetics in patients with  pulmonary arterial hypertension. The  exposure to SILDENAFIL in patients on CYP3A4 substrates and  CYP3A4  substrates plus beta -blockers was 43% and 66% higher, respectively, compared to patients  not receiving these classes of medicin al products . SILDENAFIL exposure wa s 5-fold higher at a dose of 
80 mg three times a day compared to the exposure at a dose of 20  mg three times a day. This concentration  range covers the increase in SILDENAFIL exposure observed in specifically designed drug interaction  studies with CYP3A4  inhibitors (except with the  most potent of the CYP3A4  inhibitors e .g. KETOCONAZOLE, ITRACONAZOLE, RITONAVIR).  
> Co-administration of BOSENTAN (a moderate inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and possibly of CYP2C19)  
125 mg twice daily with SILDENAFIL 80  mg three times a day (at steady state) concomitantly  administered during 6  days in heal thy volunteers resulted in a 63 % decrease of SILDENAFIL AUC. A  population pharmacokinetic analysis of SILDENAFIL data from adult PAH patients in clinical studies  including a 12  week study to assess the efficacy and safety of oral SILDENAFIL 20  mg three times a day  when added to a stable dose of BOSENTAN (62.5  mg-125 mg twice a day) indicated a decrease in  SILDENAFIL exposure with BOSENTAN co -administration, similar to that observed in healthy volunteers  (see sections  4.4 and 5.1). 
> Efficacy of s ildenafil should be closely monitored in patients using concomitant potent CYP3A4  inducers, such as CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENYTOIN, PHENOBARBITAL, St John’s wort and rifampicine. 
> Co-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor RITONAVIR , which is a highly poten t P450  inhibitor, at  steady state (500  mg twice daily) with SILDENAFIL (100  mg single dose) resulted in a 300% (4 -fold)  increase in SILDENAFIL C max and a 1,000% (11 -fold) increase in SILDENAFIL plasma AUC. At 24  hours,  the plasma levels of SILDENAFIL were still approximately 200  ng/ml, compared to approximately 5  ng/ml  when SILDENAFIL was administered alone. This is consistent with RITONAVIR’s marked effects on a broad   
7 range of P450  substrates. Based on these pharmacokinetic results co -administration of SILDENAFIL with  RITONAVIR is contraindicated in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients (see section  4.3). 
> Co-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor SAQUINAVIR, a CYP3A4  inhibitor, at steady state  (1200  mg three times a day) with SILDENAFIL (100  mg single dose) resulted in a 140 % increase in  SILDENAFIL C max and a 210% increase in SILDENAFIL AUC. SILDENAFIL had no effect on SAQUINAVIR  pharmacokinetics. For do se recommendations, see section  4.2.
> When a single 100  mg dose of SILDENAFIL was administer ed with ERYTHROMYCIN, a moderate CYP3A4  inhibitor, at st eady state (500  mg twice daily for 5  days), there was a 182% increase in SILDENAFIL  systemic exposure (AUC). For do se recommendations, see section  4.2. In healthy male volunteers,  there was no evidenc e of an effect of AZITHROMYCIN (500  mg daily for 3  days) on the AUC, C max, Tmax, elimination rate constant, or subsequent half -life of SILDENAFIL or its principal circulating metabolite.  No dose adjustment is required. CIMETIDINE (800  mg), a cytochrome P450  inhibitor and a non -specific  CYP3A4  inhibitor, caused a 56% increase in plasma SILDENAFIL concentrations when co -administered  with SILDENAFIL (50  mg) to healthy volunteers. No dose adjustment is required. 
> The most potent of the CYP3A4  inhibitors such  as KETOCONAZOLE and ITRACONAZOLE would be expected  to have effects similar to RITONAVIR (see section 4.3). CYP3A4  inhibitors like CLARITHROMYCIN,  TELITHROMYCIN and NEFAZODONE are expected to have an effect in between that of RITONAVIR and CYP3A4  inhibitor s like SAQUINAVIR or ERYTHROMYCIN, a seven -fold increase in exposure is assumed. Therefore  dose adjustments are recommended when using CYP3A4  inhibitors (see section  4.2).
> The population pharmacokinetic analysis in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients  suggested that  co-administration of beta -blockers in combi nation with CYP3A4  substrates might result in an  additional increase in SILDENAFIL exposure compare d with administration of CYP3A4  substrates alone. 
> GRAPEFRUIT JUICE is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4  gut wall metabolism and may give rise to modest  increases in plasma levels of SILDENAFIL. No dose adjustment is required but the concomitant use of  SILDENAFIL and GRAPEFRUIT JUICE is not recommended. 
> Co-administration of oral contr aceptives (ethinyloestradiol 30  µg and LEVONORGESTREL 150  µg) did not  affect the pharmacokinetics of SILDENAFIL. 
> NICORANDIL is a hybrid of POTASSIUM channel activator and nitrate. Due to the nitrate component it has  the potential to have serious interaction with SILDENAFIL (see section  4.3).
> SILDENAFIL had no significant effect on ATORVASTATIN exposure (AUC increased 11%), suggesting that  SILDENAFIL does not have a clinically relevant effect on CYP3A4. 
> No interactions were observed between SILDENAFIL (100  mg single dose) and ACENOCOUMAROL.   
8  SILDENAFIL (50  mg) did not potentiate the increase in bleeding time caused by acetyl SALICYLIC ACID  (150 mg). 
> In a study of healthy volunteers  SILDENAFIL at steady state (80  mg thre e times a day) resulted in a 50 % increase in BOSENTAN AUC (125  mg twice daily). A population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from  a study of adult PAH patients on background BOSENTAN therapy (62.5  mg-125 mg twice a day)  indicated an increase (20% (95% CI:  9.8-30.8)) of BOSENTAN AUC with co -administr ation of steady -state SILDENAFIL (20  mg three times a day) of a smaller magnitude than seen in healthy volunteers when  co-administered with 80  mg SILDENAFIL three times a day (see sections  4.4 and 5.1).
> Hg, respectively were observed. When SILDENAFIL and DOXAZOSIN were  administered simultaneously to patients stabili sed on DOXAZOSIN therapy, ther e were infrequent reports  of patients who experienced symptomatic postural hypotension. These reports included dizziness and  lightheadedness, but not syncope. Concomitant administration of SILDENAFIL to patients taking  alpha -blocker therapy may lead to sym ptomatic hypotension in susceptible individuals (see section  4.4).
> RIOCIGUAT: Preclinical studies showed additive systemic blood pressure lowering effect when PDE5 inhibitors were combined with RIOCIGUAT. In clinical studies, RIOCIGUAT has been shown to augment the hypotensive effects of PDE5 inhibitors. There was no ev idence of favourable clinical effect of the combination in the population studied. Concomitant use of RIOCIGUAT with PDE5 inhibitors, including SILDENAFIL, is contraindicated (see section  4.3).
