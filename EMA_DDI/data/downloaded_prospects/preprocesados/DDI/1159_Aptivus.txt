> The interaction profile of APTIVUS , co-administered with low dose RITONAVIR, is complex and requires special attention in particular in combination with other antiretroviral agents.Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.Metabolic profile of tipranavir
> Tipranavir is a substrate, an inducer and an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 CYP3A. When co -administered with RITONAVIR at the recommended dosage (see section 4.2) there is a net inhibition of P450 CYP3A. Co -administration of APTIVUS and low dose RITONAVIR with agents primarily metabolised by CYP3A may result in changed plasma concentrations of tipranavir or the other agents, which could alter their therapeutic and undesirable effects (see list and details of considered agents, below). Agents that are contraindicated specifically due to the expected magnitude of interaction and potential for serious adverse reactions are detailed in this section, and listed in section 4.3.A cocktail study was conducted in 16 healthy volunteers with twice -daily 500mgtipranavir with 
200mg RITONAVIR capsule adminis tration for 10 days to assess the net effect on the activity of hepatic CYP 1A2 (CAFFEINE), 2C9 (WARFARIN), 2D6 (DEXTROMETHORPHAN), both intestinal/hepatic CYP 3A4 (MIDAZOLAM) and P -glycoprotein ( P-gp) (DIGOXIN). At steady state, there was a significant in duction of CYP 1A2 and a slight induction on CYP 2C9. Potent inhibition of CYP 2D6 and both hepatic and intestinal CYP 3A4 activities were observed. P-gpactivity is significantly inhibited after the first dose, but there was a slight induction at steady s tate. Practical recommendations deriving from this study are displayed below.Studies in human liver microsomes indicated tipranavir is an inhibitor of CYP 1A2, CYP 2C9, CYP 
2C19 and CYP 2D6. The potential net effect of tipranavir with RITONAVIR on CYP 2 D6 is inhibition, because RITONAVIR is also a CYP 2D6 inhibitor. The in vivo net effect of tipranavir with RITONAVIR on CYP 1A2, CYP 2C9 and CYP 2C19, indicates, through a preliminary study, an inducing potential of tipranavir with RITONAVIR on CYP1A2 and, to a lesser extent, on CYP2C9 and P -gp after several days of treatment. Data are not available to indicate whether tipranavir inhibits or induces glucuronosyl transferases. In vitro studies show that tipranavir is a substrate and also an inhibitor of P-gp. 9It is difficult to predict the net effect of APTIVUS co-administered with low dose RITONAVIR on oral bioavailability and plasma concentrations of agents that are dual substrates of CYP3A and P-gp. The net effect will vary depending on the relative affinity of the co -administered substance for CYP3A and P-gp, and the extent of intestinal first -pass metabolism/efflux.Co-administration of APTIVUS and agents that induce CYP3A and/or P-gpmay decrease tipranavir concentrations and reduce its therapeuti c effect (see list and details of considered agents, below). Co -administration of APTIVUS and medicinal products that inhibit P-gpmay increase tipranavir plasma concentrations.Known and theoretical interactions with selected antiretrovirals and non -antiretroviral medicinal products are listed in the table below.Interaction table

“BID” , concentration at end of dosing interval as “ Cτ”).Unless otherwise stated, studies detailed below have been performed with the recommended dosage of APTIVUS /r (i.e. 500/200 mg BID). However, some PK interaction studies were not performed with this recommended dosage. Nevertheless, the results of many of these interaction studies can be extrapolated to the recommended dosage since the doses used (eg. TPV/r 500/100 mg, TPV/r 
750/200 mg) represented extremes of hepatic enzyme in duction and inhibition and bracketed the recommended dosage of APTIVUS /r.Drugs by therapeutic area Interaction

Greater effects may be expected when FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE is inhaled. Systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression have been reported in patients receiving RITONAVIR and inhaled or intranasally administered FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE; this could also occur with other CORTICOSTEROIDS metabolised via the P450 3A pathway e.g. BUDESONIDE. It is unknown whether the combination of tipranavir with RITONAVIR might cause a larger increase in FLUTICASONE exposure.Concomitant administration of Aptivu s, co-administered with low dose RITONAVIR, and these GLUCOCORTICOIDS is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 4.4). A dose reduction of the glucocorticoid should be con sidered with close monitoring of local and systemic effects or a switch to a glucocorticoid, which is not a substrate for CYP3A4 (e.g. BECLOMETHASONE). Moreover, in case of withdrawal of GLUCOCORTICOIDS progressive dose reduction may have to be performed o ver a longer period. The effects of high FLUTICASONE systemic exposure on RITONAVIR plasma levels are as yet unknown.
