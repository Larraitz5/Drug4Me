> Given the primary effects of asenapine  on the CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (CNS) (see section  4.8), caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicinal products. Patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking SYCREST. 
> During combined administration with a single dose of asenapine 5  mg, FLUVOXAMINE 25  mg twice daily resulted in a 29  % increase in asenapine AUC. The full therapeutic dose of FLUVOXAMINE would be expected to produce a greater increase in asenapine plasma concentrations. Therefore, co-administration of asenapine and FLUVOXAMINE should be approached with caution. 
> Asen apine may antagonise the effect of LEVODOPA and DOPAMINE AGONISTS. If this combination is deemed necessary, the lowest effective dose of each treatment should be prescribed.

− Following co -administration of DEXTROMETHORPHAN and asenapine in healthy subjects, the ratio of dextrorphan/DEXTROMETHORPHAN (DX/DM) as a marker o f CYP2D6 activity was measured. Indicative of CYP2D6 inhibition, treatment with asenapine 5  mg twice daily resulted in a fractional decrease in DX/DM ratio to 0.43. In the same study, treatment with PAROXETINE 20  mg daily decreased the DX/DM ratio to 0.032 .
> 
− Co-administration of a single 20  mg dose of PAROXETINE (a CYP2D6 substrate and inhibitor) during treatment with 5  mg asenapine  twice daily in 15  healthy male subjects resulted in an almost 2 -fold increase in PAROXETINE exposure.
