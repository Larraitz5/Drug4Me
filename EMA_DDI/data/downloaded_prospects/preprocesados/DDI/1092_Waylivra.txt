> No clinical drug interaction studies have been conducted.  Clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions are not expected between volanesorsen  and substrates, inducers or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) ENZYMES, and drug transporters. It is unknown whether triglyceride  lowering by volanesorsen a nd the potentially ensuing decrease in inflammation leads to normalisation of CYP enzyme expression. 
> In clinical studies, this medicinal product  has been used in combination with FIBRATES and fish oils with no impact on the medicinal product  pharmacodynam ics or pharmacokinetics. There were no adverse 6 events related to drug- drug interactions reported during the clinical program , however this is based on limited data .
> ANTITHROMBOTIC AGENTS and medicinal products that may lower platelet count  It is not known whether the risk of bleeding is increased by concomitant use of volanesorsen and ANTITHROMBOTIC AGENTS or medicinal products that may lower platelet count or affect platelet function. Discontinuation of antiplatelet medicinal products/NSAIDs/anticoagulants should be considered for  platelet levels <75 x 109/L and treatment with these medicinal products should be stopped at platelet  levels < 50 x 109/L (see section 4.4).
