> Cabotegravir is primarily metabolised by URIDINE diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase ( UGT ) 1A1 and to a lesser extent by  UGT1A9. Medicinal products which are strong inducers of UGT1A1 or UGT1A9 are expected to decrease cabotegravir plasma concentrations leading to lack of efficacy (see section 4.3 and T able 3 below ).  In poor metaboli sers of UGT1A1, representing a maximum clinical UGT1A1 inhibition, the mean AUC, Cmax and C tau of oral cabotegravir increased by up t o 1.5- fold. No dosing adjustments for APRETUDE  are recommended in the presence of UGT1A1 inhibitors. 
> Medicinal products by therapeutic areas  Interaction  Geometric mean change (%)  Recommendations concerning co-administration  HIV-1 Antiviral medicinal products  Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor:  ETRAVIRINE  Cabotegravir ↔ AUC ↑  1% Cmax ↑ 4% Cτ ↔ 0%
> ETRAVIRINE did not significantly change cabotegravir plasma concentration. No dose adjustment of APRETUDE  is necessary when initiating injections following ETRAVIRINE use.  Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor:  RILPIVIRINE  Cabotegravir ↔ AUC ↑ 12%  Cmax ↑ 5% Cτ ↑ 14%  RILPIVIRINE ↔  AUC ↓ 1% Cmax ↓ 4% Cτ ↓ 8% RILPIVIRINE did not significantly change cabotegravir plasma concentration or vice versa. No dose adjustment of APRETUDE  or RILPIVIRINE is necessary when co -administered.  Anticonvulsants  CARBAMAZEPINE  OXCARBAZEPINE  PHENYTOIN  PHENOBARBITAL  Cabotegravir ↓ Metabolic inducers may significantly decrease cabotegravir plasma concentration. Concomitant use is contraindicated  (see section 4.3) . ANTIMYCOBACTERIALS  Rifampicin

 Cabotegravir ↓ AUC ↓  59%  Cmax ↓ 6% Rifampicin significantly decreased cabotegravir plasma concentration which is likely to result in loss of therapeutic effect. Dosing recommendations for co -administration of APRETUDE  with rifampicin have not been established and co- administration of Apretu de with rifampicin is contraindicated (see section 4.3) .
> RIFAPENTINE  Cabotegravir ↓ RIFAPENTINE may significantly decrease cabotegravir plasma concentrations. Concomitant use is contraindicated  (see section 4.3) . RIFABUTIN
