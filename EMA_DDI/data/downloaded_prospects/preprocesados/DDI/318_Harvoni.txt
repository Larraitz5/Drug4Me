> LEDIPASVIR  is an in  vitro  inhibitor of drug transporter P -gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and may increase intestinal absorption of co -administered substrates for these transporters.  
> Medicinal products that are strong P -gp inducers (CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENOBARBITAL, PHENYTOIN, rifampicin, RIFABUTIN and St. John’s wort) may significantly decr ease LEDIPASVIR and SOFOSBUVIR plasma concentrations leading to reduced therapeutic effect of LEDIPASVIR/SOFOSBUVIR and thus are contraindicated with HARVONI (see section  4.3). Medicinal products that are moderate P -gp inducers in the intestine (e.g. oxcar bazepine) may decrease LEDIPASVIR and SOFOSBUVIR plasma concentrations leading to reduced therapeutic effect of HARVONI.  Co-administration with such medicinal products is not recommended with HARVONI (see section  4.4). Co-administration with medicinal prod ucts that inhibit P- gp and/or BCRP may increase LEDIPASVIR and SOFOSBUVIR plasma concentrations without increasing GS -331007 plasma concentration; HARVONI may be co-administered with P -gp and/or BCRP  inhibitors.  Clinically significant medicinal product interactions with LEDIPASVIR/SOFOSBUVIR mediated by CYP450s or UGT1A1 ENZYMES are not expected.
