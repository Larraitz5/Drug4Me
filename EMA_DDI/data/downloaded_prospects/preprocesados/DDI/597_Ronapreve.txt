> No formal drug- drug interaction studies have been performed. CASIRIVIMAB and IMDEVIMAB are MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES, which are not renally excreted or metabolised by cytochrome P450 ENZYMES; therefore, interactions with concomitant medicinal products that are renally excreted or that are substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 ENZYMES are unlikely.
