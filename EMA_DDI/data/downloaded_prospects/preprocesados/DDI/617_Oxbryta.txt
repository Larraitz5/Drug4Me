> Coadministration of strong CYP3A4 inducers may decrease voxelotor exposures and may lead to reduced efficacy.Coadministration of voxelotor with strong CYP3A4 inducers (i.e., rifampicin, PHENOBARBITAL, CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENYTOIN, and St Johnâ€™s wort extract ) should be avoided .Other interactions studied
> Voxelotor increased the systemic exposure of MIDAZOLAM (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate). The observed exposure increase of the CYP3A4 su bstrate MIDAZOLAM was 1.6 -fold in healthy subjects at avoxelotor sub-therapeutic dose ( observed voxelotor Cmax 7.0-8.0micro gram/m
> L). The effect at the full dose level of voxelotor is expected to be larger .Coadministration of voxelotor with sensitive CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (i.e., ALFENTANIL, SIROLIMUS, and TACROLIMUS) should be avoided . If concomitant use is unavoidable, consider dose reduction o f the sensitive CYP3A4 substrate(s).CYP2B6 substrates
> In vitro studies indicated that voxelotor may act as an inhibitor of OATP1B1, OAT3 and MATE1 transporters (see section 5.2). Therefore, caution is recommended when co -administering voxelotor with sensitive substrates of these transporters, especially for those substrates with a narrow therapeutic index .Concomitant use of voxelotor with DIGOXIN (a P -gp substrate) did not alter DIGOXIN to a clinically relevant extent. Voxelotor is not an inhibitor of bile salt export pump (BSEP). It is not known if voxelotor affects the oral absorption of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP )subst rates.Oral contraceptives and other steroidal agents
