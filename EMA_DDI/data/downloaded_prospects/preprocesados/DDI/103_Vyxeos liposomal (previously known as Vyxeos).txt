> No interacti on studies have been performed  with Vyxeos liposomal . The delivery of DAUNORUBICIN and CYTARABINE in the Vyxeos liposomal  formulation is anticipated to reduce the possibility of interactions, because systemic free concentrations of DAUNORUBICIN and CYTARABINE are much lower than when administered as the non -liposomal formulation. 
> Cardiotoxic agents  Concurrent use of cardiot oxic agents may increase the risk of cardiotoxicity. Use of Vyxeos liposomal  in patients who have previously received DOXORUBICIN increases the risk of cardiotoxicity ( see section 
4.4). Do not administer Vyxeos liposomal  in combination with other cardiotoxic agents unless the patient's cardiac function is closely monitored. 
> Hepatotoxic agents Hepatotoxic medicinal products  may impair liver function and increase the toxicity. Since DAUNORUBICIN is metabolis ed by t he liver, changes in hepatic fu nction induced by concomi tant therapies may affect metabolism, pharmacokinetics, therapeutic efficacy, and/or the toxicity of Vyxeos liposomal  (see section 5.2) . Hepatic function should be monitored more frequently when Vyxeos liposomal  is coadministered with hepatoxic agents.
