6 CYP3A4 inducers  Pretomanid is metabolized in part by CYP3A4. In consequence, exposure to pretomanid may be reduced during co -administration with inducers of CYP3A4. In interaction studies of multiple -dose pretomanid with multiple -dose rifampicin or EFAVIRENZ, the AUC 0-24h of pretomanid was reduced by 
66% or 35%, respectively. Due to the possibility of a reduction of the therapeutic effect of pretomanid due to a decrease in systemic exposure, co -administrati on of pretomanid and moderate or strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. EFAVIRENZ, ETRAVIRINE, rifamycins including rifampicin, RIFAPENTINE and RIFABUTIN, CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENYTOIN, St. Johnâ€™s wort ( Hypericum perforatum )) used systemically should be avoided (see sect ion 4.4). 
> Effect on OAT3 , OATP1B3, P -gp and BC RP substrates  Pretomanid is an inhibitor of the OAT3 transporter in vitro , which could result in increased concentrations of OAT3 substrate medicinal products clinically and may increase the risk of adverse reactions of these medicines.  If pretomanid is co -administered with OAT3 substrate medicinal products (e.g., METHOTREXATE, benzylpenicillin, INDOMETHACIN, CIPROFLOXACIN), monitoring for OAT3 substrate drug -related adverse reactions should be performed and dosage reductions for OAT3  substrate medicinal pr oduct should be considered, if needed (see section 4.4). 
> In vitro  studies indicate that pretomanid is an inhibitor of BCRP, OATP1B3 and P -gp. No clinical studies have been performed to investigate these interactions. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that  co-administration of pretomanid with sensitive OATP1B3 substrates (e.g., VALSARTAN, statins), BCRP substrates (e.g. ROSUVASTATIN, PRAZOSIN, GLYBURIDE, SULFASALAZINE) and P -gp substrates (e.g. DIGOXIN, DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE, VERAPAMIL) may increase their ex posure. If pretomanid is co -administered with substrates of OATP1B3, BCRP or P -gp, monitoring for drug -related adverse reactions to the co -administered medicinal product should be performed.
