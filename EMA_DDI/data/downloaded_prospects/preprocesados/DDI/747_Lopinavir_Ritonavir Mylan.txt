Increased monitoring for rif abutin-associated adverse reactions including neutropenia and uveitis is warranted due to an expected increase in exposure to RIFABUTIN. Further dosage reduction of RIFABUTIN to 150 mg twice weekly on set days is recommended for patients in whom the 150 mg dose 
3 times per week is not tolerated. It should be kept in mi nd that the twice weekly dosage of 150 mg may not provide an optimal exposure to RIFABUTIN thus leading to a risk of rifamycin resistance and a treatment failure. No dose adjustment is needed for LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR MYLAN.  Rifampicin LOPINAVIR:  Large decreases in LOPINAVIR concentrations may be observed due to CYP3A induction by rifampicin. Co-administration of LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR MYLAN with rifampicin is not recommended as the decrease in LOPINAVIR concentrations may in turn signifi cantly decrease the LOPINAVIR therapeutic effect. A dose adjustment of LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR MYLAN 400 mg/400 mg (i.e. LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR MYLAN 
400/100 mg + RITONAVIR 300 mg) twice daily has allowed compensating for the CYP 3A4 inducer effect of rifampicin. However, such a dose adjustment might be associated with ALT/AST elevations and with increase in gastroin testinal disorders. Therefore, this co-administration should be avoided unless judged strictly necessary. If this co-administration is judged unavoidable, increased dose of LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR MYLAN at 400 mg/400 mg twice daily may be administere d with rifampicin under close safety and therapeutic drug monitoring. The LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR MYLAN dose should be titrated u pward only after rifampicin has b een initiated (see section 4.4).

> Effects on drug levels  Geometric Mean Change (%) in AUC, C max, C min  Mechanism of interaction  Clinical recommendation concerning co-administration with LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR MYLAN 
> Herbal products  St John’s wort  (Hypericum perforatum)  LOPINAVIR:  Concentrations may be reduced due to induction of CYP3A by the herbal preparation St John’s wort.  Herbal preparations  containing St John’s wort must not be combined with LOPINAVIR and  RITONAVIR. If a patient is already taking St John’s wort, stop St John’s wort and if possible check viral levels. LOPINAVIR and RITONAVIR levels may increase on stopping St John’s wort. The dose of LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR MYLAN may need adjusting. The inducing effect may persist for at least 2 weeks after cessation of treatment with St John’s wort (see section 4.3). Therefore, LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR MYLAN can be started safely 2 weeks after cessation of St John's wort. IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS  Cyclosporin, SIROLIMUS (rapamycin), and TACROLIMUS  Cyclosporin, SIROLIMUS (rapamycin), TACROLIMUS:  Concentrations may be increased due to CYP3A inhibition by LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR.  More frequent therapeutic concentration monitoring is recommended until p lasma levels of these products hav e been stabilised. Lipid lowering agents  LOVASTATIN and SIMVASTATIN  LOVASTATIN, SIMVASTATIN:  Markedly increased plasma concentrations due to CYP3A inhibition by LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR. Since increased concentrations of HMG-Co
> A reductase inhibitors may cause myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, th e combination of these agents with LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR MYLAN is contraindicated (see section 4.3).  Lipid-modifying agents  LOMITAPIDE CYP3A4 inhibitors increase the exposure of LOMITAPIDE, with strong inhibitors increasing exposure approximately 27-fold. Due to CYP3A inhibition by LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR, concentrations of LOMITAPIDE are expec ted to increase. Concomitant use of LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR MYLAN with LOMITAPIDE is cont raindicated (see prescribing information for LOMITAPIDE) (see section 4.3). ATORVASTATIN A torvastatin:  AUC: ↑ 5.9 -fold  Cmax: ↑ 4.7-fold  Due to CYP3A inhibition by LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR. The combination of LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR MYLAN with ATORVASTATIN is not recommended. If the use of atorvasta tin is considered strictly necessary, the lowest possible dose of ATORVASTATIN should be administered with careful safety monitoring (see section 4.4).

> ROSUVASTATIN, 20 mg QD ROSUVASTATIN:  AUC: ↑ 2-fold  Cmax: ↑ 5-fold  While rosuvasta tin is poorly metabolised by CYP3A4, an increase of its plasma conc entrations was observed. The mechanism of this interaction may resu lt from inhibition of transport proteins.  Caution should be exercised and reduced doses should be considered when LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR MYLAN is co-administered with  ROSUVASTATIN (see section 4.4).  FLUVASTATIN or PRAVASTATIN F luvastatin, PRAVASTATIN:  No clinical relev ant interaction expected.  PRAVASTATIN is no t metabolised by CYP450.  FLUVASTATIN is par tially metabolised by CYP2C9. If treatment with an HMG-Co

METHADONE METHADONE: ↓ Monitori ng plasma concentrations of METHADONE is recommended.Oral contraceptives  Ethinyl Oestradiol Ethinyl Oestradiol: ↓ In case of co-administration of LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR MYLAN with contraceptives containing ethinyl oestradiol (whatever the contraceptive formulation e.g. o ral or patch), additional methods of contraception must be used. Smoking cessation aids  BUPROPION Buproprion a nd its active metabolite, hydroxybupropion:  AUC and C max ↓ ~50%  This effect may be due to induction of BUPROPION metabolism. If the co-administration of LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR MYLAN with BUPROPION is judged unavoidable, this should be done under close clinical monitoring for BUPROPION efficacy, without exceedin g the recommended dosage, despite the observed induction. THYROID hormone replacement therap y LEVOTHYROXINE Post marketing cases have been reported indicating a potential interaction between RITONAVIR containing products and LEVOTHYROXINE. THYROID stimulating hormone (TSH) should be monito red in patients treated with levothyro xine at least the first month after starting and/or ending LOPINAVIR/rito navir treatment.
