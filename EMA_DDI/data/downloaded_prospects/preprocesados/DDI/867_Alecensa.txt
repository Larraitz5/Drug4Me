> CYP3A inducers  Co-administration of multiple oral doses of 600  mg rifampicin once daily, a strong CYP3A inducer, with a single oral dose of 600  mg ALECTINIB reduced ALECTINIB C max, and AUC inf by 51% and 73% respectively and increased M4 C max and AUC inf 2.20 and 1.79 -fold respectively. The effect on the combined exposure of ALECTINIB and M4 was minor, reducing C max and AUC inf by 4% and 18%, respectively. Based on the effects on the combined exposure of ALECTINIB and M4, no dose adjustments are required when ALECENSA  is co-administered with CYP3A inducers. Appropriate monitoring is recommended for patients taking concomitant strong CYP3A inducers (including, but not limited to, CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENOBARBITAL, PHENYTOIN, RIFABUTIN, rifampicin and St. Johnâ€™s Wort (Hypericum perforatum)). 
> CYP3A inhibitors   Co-administration of multiple oral doses of 400  mg POSACONAZOLE twice daily, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, with a single oral dose of 300  mg ALECTINIB  increased ALECTINIB  exposure C max and AUC inf by 
1.18 and 1.75 -fold respectively, and reduced M4 C max and AUC inf by 71% and 25% respectively.  The effect on the combined exposure of ALECTINIB  and M4 was minor, reducing C max by 7% and increasing AUC inf 1.36-fold. Based on the effects on the combined exposure of ALECTINIB  and M4, no dose adjustments are required when ALECENSA  is co-administered with CYP3A inhibitors. Appropriate monitoring is recommended for patients taking concomitant strong CYP3A inhibitors (including, but not limited to, RITONAVIR, SAQUINAVIR, TELITHROMYCIN, KETOCONAZOLE, ITRACONAZOLE, VORICONAZOLE, POSACONAZOLE NEFAZODONE, grapefruit or Seville oranges). 
> Multiple doses of 600 mg ALECTINIB  had no influence on the exposure of MIDAZOLAM (2 mg), a sensitive CYP3A substrate . Therefore , no dose adjustment is required for co -administered CYP3A substrates.  A risk for induction of CYP2B6 and  pregnane X receptor ( PXR ) regulated ENZYMES apart from CYP3A4 cannot be completely excluded. The effectiveness of concomitant administration of oral contraceptives may be reduced .
> P-gp substrates  In vitro , ALECTINIB and  its major active metabolite  M4 are inhibitors of the efflux transporter  P-gp. Therefore, ALECTINIB  and M4 may have the potential to increase plasma concentrations of co-administered substrates of P -gp. When ALECENSA  is co-administered with P -gp substrates (e.g., 8 DIGOXIN, DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE, TOPOTECAN, SIROLIMUS, EVEROLIMUS, NILOTINIB and LAPATINIB ), appropriate monitoring is recommended. 
> Breast cancer resistance protein  (BCRP ) substrates  In vitro , ALECTINIB and M4 are inhibitors of the efflux transporter  BCRP. Therefore, ALECTINIB  and M4  may have the potential to increase plasma concentrations of co -administered substrates of BCRP.  When ALECENSA  is co-administered with BCRP substrates (e.g., METHOTREXATE, MITOXANTRONE, TOPOTECAN and LAPATINIB ), appropriate monitoring is recommended.
