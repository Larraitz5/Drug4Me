> Strong CYP3A inhibitors  In healthy subjects, co -administration of a single 200  mg CAPMATINIB  dose with the strong CYP3A inhibitor ITRACONAZOLE  (200 mg once daily for 10  days)  increased CAPMATINIB AUC inf by 42% with no change in CAPMATINIB C max compared to administration of CAPMATINIB alone. Patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactio ns during co -administration of TABRECTA with strong CYP3A inhibitors, including but not limited to, CLARITHROMYCIN, INDINAVIR, ITRACONAZOLE, KETOCONAZOLE, LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR, NEFAZODONE, NELFINAVIR, POSACONAZOLE, RITONAVIR, SAQUINAVIR, TELAPREVIR, telithr omycin, VERAPAMIL, and VORICONAZOLE .
> Strong CYP3A inducers  In healthy subjects, co -administration of a single 400  mg CAPMATINIB dose with the strong CYP3A inducer rifampicin  (600 mg once daily for 9  days)  decreased CAPMATINIB AUC inf by 67% and decreased Cmax by 56% compared to administration of CAPMATINIB alone. Decreases in CAPMATINIB exposure may decrease TABRECTA anti -tumo ur activity. Co -administration of TABRECTA  with strong CYP3A inducers, including but not limited to, CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENOBARBITAL, PHENYTOIN, rifampicin and St. Johnâ€™s wort (Hypericum perforatum) , should be avoided. An alternative medicinal product  with no or minimal potential to induce CYP3A shou ld be considered. 
> Moderate CYP3A inducers  Simulations using physiologically -based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models predicted that co-administration of a 400  mg CAPMATINIB dose with the m oderate CYP3A inducer EFAVIRENZ  (600 mg daily for 20  days)  would result in a 44% decrease in CAPMATINIB AUC 0-12h and 34% decrease in C max at steady -state compared to administration of CAPMATINIB alone. Decreases in CAPMATINIB exposure may decrease TABRECTA anti -tumo ur activity. Caution should be exercised during co -administrat ion of TABRECTA with moderate CYP3A inducers. 
> H increases in vitro . In healthy subjects, co -administration of a single 600  mg CAPMATINIB dose with  the proton pump inhibitor RABEPRAZOLE (20  mg once daily for 4  days) decreased CAPMATINIB AUC inf by 25% and decreased C max by 38 % compared to administration of CAPMATINIB alone.  Clinically relevant drug -drug interactions between CAPMATINIB and gastric -acid-reducing agents are unlikely to occur as co-administration of RABEPRAZOLE had no clinically meaningful effect on exposure of CAPMATINIB. 
> Substrates of CYP enyzmes  Moderate inhibition of CYP1A2 was observed when CAPMATINIB was co-administered with  the sensitive CYP1A2 substrate CAFFEINE. Co -administration of CAPMATINIB (400  mg twice daily) with CAFFEINE increased CAFFEINE AUC inf by 134%. If CAPMATINIB is co -administered with narrow therapeutic index CYP1A2 substrates, such as  THEOPHYLLINE and TIZANIDINE, dose reduction of the co-administered  medicinal product  may be required. 
> 8 P-glycoprotein (P -gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) substrates  In cancer patients, co -administration of DIGOXIN (P -gp substrate) with multiple doses of CAPMATINIB (400 mg twice daily) increased DIGOXIN AUC inf by 47% and increased C max by 74% compared to administration of DIGOXIN alone. In cancer patients, co -administration of r osuvastatin (BCRP substrate) with multiple doses of CAPMATINIB (400  mg twice daily) increased ROSUVASTATIN AUC inf by 108% and increased C max by 204% compared to administration of ROSUVASTATIN alone. Co -administration of TABRECTA with a P -gp or BCRP substra te may increase the incidence and severity of adverse reactions of these substrates.  Caution should be exercised  during co -administration of TABRECTA with P -gp (DIGOXIN, DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE, COLCHICINE, SITAGLIPTIN, SAXAGLIPTIN and POSACONAZOLE) or BCRP (METHOTREXATE, ROSUVASTATIN, PRAVASTATIN, MITOXANTRONE and sulphasalazine) substrates. If CAPMATINIB is co-administered with narrow therapeutic index P -gp or BCRP substrates, dose reduction of the co-administered medicinal product may be required.
