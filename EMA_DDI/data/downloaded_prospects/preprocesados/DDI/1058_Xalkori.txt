> Coadministration of crizotinib with strong CYP3A inhibitors is expected to increase crizotinib plasma conc entrations. Coadministration of a single 150 mg oral dose of crizotinib in the presence of KETOCONAZOLE (200 mg twice daily), a strong CYP3A inhibitor, resulted in increases in crizotinib systemic exposure, with crizotinib area -under -the-plasma -concentrati on versus time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC inf) and maximum observed plasma concentration (C max) values that were approximately 3.2 -fold and 1.4 -fold, respectively, those seen when crizotinib was administered alone.Coadministration of repeated doses of crizotinib (250 mg once daily) with repeated doses of ITRACONAZOLE (200 mg once daily), a strong CYP3A inhibitor, resulted in increases in crizotinib steady -state AUC tauand C max, that were approximately 1.6 -fold and 1 .3-fold, respectively, those seen when crizotinib was administered alone.Therefore, the concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors (including but not limited to ATAZANAVIR, RITONAVIR, COBICISTAT, ITRACONAZOLE, KETOCONAZOLE, POSACONAZOLE, VORICONAZOLE , CLARITHROMYCIN, TELITHROMYCIN, and ERYTHROMYCIN ) should be avoided. Unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk, in which case patients should be closely monitored for crizotinib adverse events (see section 4.4).Physiologically -based pha rmacokinetic (PBPK) simulations predicted a 17% increase in crizotinib steady -state AUC after treatment with the moderate CYP3A inhibitors, DILTIAZEM or VERAPAMIL. 13Caution is therefore recommended in case of coadministration of crizotinib with moderate CYP 3Ainhibitors.Grapefruit or GRAPEFRUIT JUICE may also increase plasma concentrations of crizotinib and should be avoided (see sections 4.2and 4.4).Agents that may decrease crizotinib plasma concentrations
> Coadministration of repeated doses of crizotin ib (250 mg twice daily) with repeated doses of rifampicin (600 mg once daily), a strong CYP3A4 inducer, resulted in 84% and 79% decreases in crizotinib steady -state AUC tauand C max, respectively, compared to when crizotinib was given alone. The concurrent use of strong CYP3A inducers, including but not limited to CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENOBARBITAL, PHENYTOIN, rifampicin, and St. Johnâ€™s wort, should be avoided (see section 4.4).The effect of a moderate inducer including but not limited to EFAVIRENZ or RIFABUTIN is not clearly established ;therefore, their combination with crizotinib should be also avoided (see section 4.4).Coadministration with medicinal products that increase gastric p
> Hresulting in higher solubility. Administration of a single 250 mg crizotinib dose following treatment with ESOMEPRAZOLE 
40mg once daily for 5 days resulted in an approximately 10% decrease in crizotinib total exposure (AUC inf) and no change in peak expos ure (C max); the extent of the change in total exposure was not clinically meaningful. Therefore, starting dose adjustment is not required when crizotinib is coadministered with agents that increase gastric p
> Following 28 days of crizotinib dosing at 250 mg taken twice daily in cancer patients, the oral MIDAZOLAM AUC infwas 3.7 -fold of those seen when MIDAZOLAM was administered alone, suggesting that crizotinib is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A. Therefore, coadministration of crizotinib with CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic indices, including but not limited to ALFENTANIL, CISAPRIDE, CYCLOSPORINE, ergot derivatives, FENTANYL, PIMOZIDE, QUINIDINE, SIROLIMUS, and TACROLIMUS should be avoided (see section 4.4). If the combination is needed, then close clinical monitoring should be exercised.In vitro studies indicated that cr izotinib is an inhibitor of CYP2B6. Therefore, crizotinib may have the potential to increase plasma concentrations of coadministered medicinal products that are metaboli sedby CYP2B6 (e.g., BUPROPION, EFAVIRENZ).In vitro studies in human hepatocytes indi cated that crizotinib may induce pregnane Xreceptor (PXR) -and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR )-regulated ENZYMES (e.g., CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, UGT1A1). However, there was no observed induction in vivo when crizotinib was coadministered wit h the CYP3A probe substrate MIDAZOLAM. Caution should be exercised in administering crizotinib in combination with medicinal products that are predominantly metabolised by these ENZYMES. Of note, the effectiveness of concomitant administration of oral contraceptives may be reduced.In vitro studies indicated that crizotinib is a weak inhibitor of URIDINE diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A1 and UGT2B7. Therefore, crizotinib may ha ve the potential to increase plasma concentrations of coadministered medicinal products that are metaboli sedpredominantly by UGT1A1 (e.g., RALTEGRAVIR, IRINOTECAN) or UGT2B7 (e.g., MORPHINE, NALOXONE).Based on an in vitro study, crizotinib is predicted to inhibit intestinal P -gp. Therefore, administration of crizotinib with medicinal products that are substrates of P -gp (e.g., DIGOXIN, DABIGATRAN, COLCHICINE, PRAVASTATIN) may increase their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions . Close clinical surveil lance is recommended when crizotinib is administered with these medicinal products.14Crizotinib is an inhibitor of OCT1 and OCT2 in vitro. Therefore, crizotinib may have the potential to increase plasma concentrations of coadministered medicinal products that are substrates of OCT1 or OCT2 (e.g., METFORMIN, PROCAINAMIDE).Pharmacodynamic interactions
> In clinical studies, prolonged QT interval was observed with crizotinib. Therefore, the concomitant use of crizotinib with medicinal products known to prol ong QT interval or medicinal products able to induce Torsades de pointes (e.g., class IA [QUINIDINE, DISOPYRAMIDE] or class III [e.g., AMIODARONE, SOTALOL, DOFETILIDE, IBUTILIDE], METHADONE, CISAPRIDE, moxifloxacine, ANTIPSYCHOTICS, etc.) should be careful ly considered. A monitoring of the QT interval should be made in case of combinations of such medicinal products (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).Bradycardia has been reported during clinical studies; therefore, use crizotinib with caution due to the risk of excessive bradycardia when used in combination with other bradycardic agents (e.g., non-dihydropyridine CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS such as VERAPAMIL and DILTIAZEM, beta -blockers, CLONIDINE, GUANFACINE, DIGOXIN, MEFLOQUINE, an ticholinesterases, PILOCARPINE) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
