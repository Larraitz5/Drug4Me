> CYP3A4 inhibitors  In an interaction study, a 3.7- fold increase in maximum silodosin plasma concentrations a nd a 3.1- fold increase in silodosin exposure (i.e. AUC) were observed with concurrent administration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor (KETOCONAZOLE 400 mg). Concomitant use with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as KETOCONAZOLE, ITRACONAZOLE , RITONAVIR  or CYCLOSPORINE ) is not recommended.  When silodosin was co- administered with a CYP3A4 inhibitor of moderate potency such as DILTIAZEM, an increase in silodosin AUC of approximately 30% was observed, but C max and half -life were not affected. This change is clinically  not relevant and no dose adjustment is required.
> PDE -5 inhibitors  Minimal pharmacodynamic interactions have been observed between silodosin and maximum doses of SILDENAFIL or TADALAFIL. In a placebo -controlled study in 24 subjects 45 -78 years of age rece iving silodosin, the co- administration of SILDENAFIL 100 mg or TADALAFIL 20 mg induced no clinically meaningful mean decreases in systolic or diastolic blood pressure, as assessed by orthostatic tests (standing versus supine). In the subjects over 65 years , the mean decreases at the VARIOUS time points were between 5  and 15 mm
> ANTIHYPERTENSIVES  In the clinical study program, many patients were on concomitant antihypertensive therapy (mostly agents acting on the renin -angiotensin system, beta -blockers, CALCIUM antagonists and DIURETICS) without experiencing an increase in the incidence of orthostatic hypotension. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when starting concomitant use with ANTIHYPERTENSIVES and pat ients should be monitored for possible adverse reactions. 
> DIGOXIN  Steady state levels of DIGOXIN, a substrate of P -glycoprotein, were not significantly affected by co-administration with silodosin 8 mg once daily. No dose adjustment is required.
