> DOLUTEGRAVIR is eliminated mainly through metabolism by URIDINE diphosphate glucuronosyl  transferase (UGT) 1A1. DOLUTEGRAVIR is also a substrate of UGT1A3, UGT1A9, CYP3A4, P -glycoprotein (P -gp), and breast cancer resistance protein  (BCRP). Co -administration of DOVATO  and other medicinal products  that inhibit UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, CYP3A4, and/or P -gp may, therefore, increase DOLUTEGRAVIR plasma concentration. Medicinal products  that induce those ENZYMES or transporters may decrease DOLUTEGRAVIR plasma concentration and reduce the therapeutic eff ect of DOLUTEGRAVIR .
> LAMIVUDINE is cleared renally. Active renal secretion of LAMIVUDINE in the urine is mediated through the  OCT2 and multidrug and toxin extrusion transporters (MATE1 and MATE2- K). TRIMETHOPRIM (an inhibitor of these transporters) has been shown to increase LAMIVUDINE plasma concentrations, however the resulting increase was not clinically significant (see Tabl e 1). DOLUTEGRAVIR is an OCT2 and MATE1 inhibitor; however, LAMIVUDINE concentrations were similar with or without co- administration of DOLUTEGRAVIR based on a cross study analysis, indicating that DOLUTEGRAVIR has no relevant effect on LAMIVUDINE exposure  in vivo . LAMIVUDINE is also substrate of the hepatic uptake transporter  OCT1. As hepatic elimination plays a minor role in the clearance of LAMIVUDINE, drug interactions due to inhibition of OCT1 are unlikely to be of clinical significance. 
> In vitro , DOLUTEGRAVIR inhibited the re nal transporters OCT2 and MATE1. In vivo , a 10- 14% decrease of creatinine clearance (secretory fraction is dependent on OCT2 and MATE1 transport) was observed in patients. In vivo , DOLUTEGRAVIR may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products in wh ich excretion is dependent upon OCT2 and/or MATE1 (e.g. FAMPRIDINE [ also known as dalfampridine] , METFORMIN) (see Table 1 and section 4.3). 
> In vitro , DOLUTEGRAVIR inhibited the renal uptake organic anion transporters (OAT)1 and OAT3. Based on the lack of effect on the in vivo  pharmacokinetics of the OAT substrate TENOFOVIR, in vivo  inhibition of OAT1 is unlikely. Inhibition of OAT3 has not been studied in vivo . DOLUTEGRAVIR may increase plasma concentrations of medic inal products in which excretion is depe ndent upon OAT3. 
> Interactions between DOLUTEGRAVIR, LAMIVUDINE and co- administered medical products are listed in Table 1 (increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “ ↔”, area under the concentration versus time curve as “AUC”, maximum observed concentration as “C max”, concentration at end of dosing interval as 
“Cτ”). The table should not be considered exhaustive but is representative of the classes studied. 
> ETRAVIRINE ↔  (induction of UGT1A1 and CYP3A ENZYMES)  ETRAVIRINE without boosted PROTEASE INHIBITORS decreased plasma DOLUTEGRAVIR concentration. The recommended dose of DOLUTEGRAVIR is 50 mg twice dail y for patients taking ETRAVIRINE without boosted PROTEASE INHIBITORS. As DOVATO is a fixed -dose tablet, an additional 
50 mg tablet of DOLUTEGRAVIR should be administered, a pproximately 12 hours after DOVATO  for the duration of the ETRAVIRINE without booste d protease inhibitor co- administrati on (a separate formulation of DOLUTEGRAVIR  is available for this dose adjustment, see section 
4.2).  LOPINAVIR+RITONAVIR+ETRAVIRINE/ DOLUTEGRAVIR  DOLUTEGRAVIR ↔
> EFAVIRENZ ↔  (historical controls)  (induction of UGT1A1 and CYP3A ENZYMES)  The recommended dose of DOLUTEGRAVIR is 50 mg twice daily when co-administered with EFAVIRENZ. As DOVATO is a fixed -dose tablet, an additional 50 mg tablet of DOLUTEGRAVIR should be administered, a pproximately 
12 hours after DOVATO for the duration of the EFAVIRENZ co-administration (a separate formulation of dolutegravi r is available for this dose adjustment, see section 4.2) .  8 NEVIRAPINE/DOLUTEGRAVIR  DOLUTEGRAVIR ↓ (Not studied, a similar reduction in exposure as observed with EFAVIRENZ is expected, due to induction)  The recommended dose of DOLUTEGRAVIR is 50 mg twice daily when co-administered with NEVIRAPINE. As DOVATO is a fixed -dose tablet, an additional 50 mg tablet of DOLUTEGRAVIR should be administered, a pproximately 
12 hours after DOVATO for the duration of the NEVIRAPINE  co-administrati on (a separate form ulation of DOLUTEGRAVIR  is available for this dose adjustment, see section 4.2) .  RILPIVIRINE /DOLUTEGRAVIR  DOLUTEGRAVIR ↔
> DOVATO is not recommended for use in combination with EMTRICITABINE containing products, since both LAMIVUDINE (in DOVATO) and EMTRICITABINE are cytidine analogues (i.e. risk for intracellular interactions ), see section 4.4 . PROTEASE INHIBITORS  ATAZANAVIR/DOLUTEGRAVIR  DOLUTEGRAVIR ↑
> FOSAMPRENAVIR ↔ RITONAVIR ↔  (induction of UGT1A1 and CYP3A ENZYMES)  FOSAMPRENAVIR /RITONAVIR decreases DOLUTEGRAVIR concentrations, but based on limited data, did not result in decreased efficacy in Phase III studies. No dose adjustment is necessary.  LOPINAVIR+RITONAVIR/ DOLUTEGRAVIR  DOLUTEGRAVIR ↔

> In vitro  LAMIVUDINE inhibits the intracellular phosphorylation of CLADRIBINE leading to a potential risk of CLADRIBINE loss of efficacy in case of combination in the clinical setting. Some clinical findings also support a possible interaction between LAMIVUDINE an d CLADRIBINE . Concomitant use of DOVATO with CLADRIBINE is not recommended (see section 4.4).  Miscellaneous  Sorbitol  Sorbitol solution (3.2  g, 10.2  g,

When possible, avoid chronic coadministration of DOVATO with medicinal products containing sorbitol or other osmotic acting poly- alcohols or monosaccharide alcohols (eg: xylitol, MANNITOL, lactitol, maltitol). Consider more frequent monitoring of HIV -1 viral load when chronic coadministration cannot be avoided.

> Co-administration of DOLUTEGRAVIR has the potential to cause seizures due to increased FAMPRIDINE plasma concentration via inhibition of OCT2 transporter; co -administration has not been studied. FAMPRIDINE co-administration with DOVATO  is contraindicated  (see section 4. 3).  ANTACIDS and supplements  MAGNESIUM/  ALUMINIUM- containing ANTACIDS/DOLUTEGRAVIR  DOLUTEGRAVIR ↓ AUC ↓  74%  Cmax ↓ 72% 
>   Cmax ↑ 111%  A dose adjustment of METFORMIN should be considered when starting and stopping coadministration of DOVATO with METFORMIN, to maintain glycaemic control. In patients with moderate renal impairment a dose adjustment of METFORMIN should be considered when coadministered with DOVATO , because of the increased risk for lactic acidosis in patients with moderate renal impairment due to increased METFORMIN concentration (section 4.4).
