> CYP3A i nhibitors  In a clinical study , ITRACONAZOLE, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased the AUC of pirtobrutinib by 
48 % and did not change C max of pirtobrutinib. This increase in pirtobrutinib exposure is not clinically meaningful. Therefore, no dose adjustment of JAYPIRCA is necessary with CYP3A inhibitors . 
> CYP3A i nducers  In a clinical study , RIFAMPIN, a strong CYP3A inducer, decreased the AUC and C max of pirtobrutinib by 
71 % and 42 %, respectively.  Though this decrease in pirtobrutinib exposure is not expected to be clinically meaningful, if possible avoid strong CYP3A inducers (e.g. rifampicin, CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENYTOIN). 
> CYP2C8 substrates  Pirtobrutinib  is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C8. Pirtobrutinib increased the AUC and  Cmax of REPAGLINIDE (a substrate of CYP2C8) by 130 % and 98  %, respectively. Therefore, since pirtobrutinib can increase the plasma concentrations of CYP2C8 substrates, caution is advised when co-administering  with CYP2C8 substrates  (e.g. REPAGLINIDE, DASABUVIR, SELEXIPAG, ROSIGLITAZONE , PIOGLITAZONE, and MONTELUKAST ). 
> BCRP substrates  Pirtobrutinib is a moderate inhibitor of BCRP. Pirtobrutinib increased the AUC and C max of ROSUVASTATIN (a BCRP substrate) by 140  % and 146 %, respectively. Therefore, since pirtobrutinib can increase the plasma concentrations of BCRP substrates, caution i s advised when co -administering BCRP substrates (e.g. ROSUVASTATIN).  If co -administration with narrow therapeutic index BCRP substrates (e.g. high dose METHOTREXATE, MITOXANTRONE) cannot be avoided, close clinical monitoring should be considered. 
> P-gp substrates  Pirtobrutinib is a weak  inhibitor of P -gp. Pirtobrutinib increased the AUC and C max of DIGOXIN (a P -gp substrate) by 35 % and 55 %, respectively. Therefore, pirtobrutinib can increase the plasma concentrations of P -gp substrates . If co -administration with narrow therapeutic index P -gp substrates 6 (e.g DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE  and DIGOXIN) cannot be avoided, close clinical monitoring should be considered. 
> CYP2C19 substrates  Pirtobrutinib is a weak  inhibitor of CYP2C19. Pirtobrutinib increased the AUC and C max of OMEPRAZOLE (a CYP2C19 substrate) by 56 % and 49 %, respectively. Therefore, pirtobrutinib can increase the plasma concentrations of CYP2C19 substrates . If co -administration with narrow therapeutic index CYP2C19 substrates (e.g PHENOBARBITAL and MEPHENYTOIN) cannot be avoided, close clinical monitoring should be consider ed.
> CYP3A s ubstrates   Pirtobrutinib is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A. Pirtobrutinib increased the AUC and C max of orally administered MIDAZOLAM (sensitive CYP3A substrate) by 70 % and 58 %, respectively. Pirtobrutinib did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the exposure of intravenously administered MIDAZOLAM. Therefore, pirtobrutinib can increase the plasma concentrations of CYP3A substrates. If  co-administration  with narrow therapeutic index CYP3A substrates ( e.g ALFENTANIL, MIDAZOLAM, TACROLIMUS) cannot be avoided, close clinical monitoring should be considered.
