> Co-administration of 100 mg ALOGLIPTIN once daily and 1,000 mg METFORMIN hydrochloride twice daily for 6  days in healthy subjects had no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of ALOGLIPTIN or METFORMIN. 
> Cationic medicinal products  Cationic substances that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion (e.g. CIMETIDINE) may interact with METFORMIN by competing for common renal tubular tra nspor t systems. A study conducted in seven normal healthy volunteers showed that CIMETIDINE (400  mg twice daily) increased METFORMIN systemic exposure (area under the curve, AUC) by 50% and Cmax by 81%. Therefore, close monitoring of glycaemic control, dos e adj ustment within the recommended posology and changes in diabetic treatment should be considered when cationic medicinal products that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion are co -administered. 
> Combination requiring precautions for use  Some medicin al products can adversely affect renal function which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, e.g. NSAIDs, including selective cyclo -oxygenase (COX) II inhibitors, angiotensin -converting enzyme  (ACE ) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and di uretics, especially LOOP DIURETICS. When starting or using such products in combination with METFORMIN, close monitoring of renal function is necessary. 
> ACE inhibitors  ACE inhibitors may decrease blood GLUCOSE levels. If necessary, the dose of VIPDOMET should be adjusted during therapy with the other medicinal product and upon its discontinuation. 
> In vitro  studies suggest that ALOGLIPTIN does not inhibit nor induce CYP  450 isoforms at concentrations achieved with the  recommended dose of 25 mg ALOGLIPTIN (see section  5.2). Interaction with substrates of CYP 4 50 is oforms are thus not expected and have not been shown. In studies in  vitro , ALOGLIPTIN was found to be neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of key transporters associated with disposition of the active substance in the kidney: organic anion transporter -1, organic anion transporter -3 or organic cationic transporter -2 (OCT2). Furthermore, clinical data do not suggest interaction with p-glycoprotein inhibitors or substrates .
> In clinical studies, ALOGLIPTIN had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinet ics of CAFFEINE, (R)-WARFARIN, PIOGLITAZONE, GLYBURIDE, TOLBUTAMIDE, (S)-WARFARIN, DEXTROMETHORPHAN, ATORVASTATIN, MIDAZOLAM, an oral contraceptive (NORETHINDRONE and ethinyl oestradiol), DIGOXIN, FEXOFENADINE , METFORMIN, or CIMETIDINE, thus providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity to cause interaction with substrates of CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, p- glycoprotein, and OCT2.
