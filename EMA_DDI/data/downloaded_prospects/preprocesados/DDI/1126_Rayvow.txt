> LASMIDITAN has been associated with a lowering of heart rate (HR). PROPRANOLOL and LASMIDITAN together decreased HR by a mean maximum of 19.3 beats per minute ( bpm), i.e., an additional lowering of 5.1 bpm compared to PROPRANOLOL alone. This should be taken into consideration f or patients in whom these magnitudes of HR decrease may pose a concern, including patients taking medicinal products  that lower heart rate. 
> Concomitant administration of LASMIDITAN and medicinal products  (e.g., SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs) that increase serotonin may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome . Clinical experience for the use of 5 LASMIDITAN and TRIPTANS in temporal proximity is limited. The risks of developing serotonin syndrome may be additive . Caution is advised (see s ection  4.4). 
> Daily dosing of LASMIDITAN did not alter the PK of MIDAZOLAM, CAFFEINE, or TOLBUTAMIDE, which are substrates of CYP3A, CYP1A2, and CYP2C9, respectively. Coadministration of LASMIDITAN with SUMATRIPTAN  (MAO- A and OCT1 substrate) or  PROPRANOLOL  (CYP2D6 substrate)  resulted in no clinically meaningful changes in exposure of these medicinal products . Following a single dose of LASMIDITAN, creatinine renal clearance over 24  hours decreased slightly (11 %) compared with placebo, without changes in glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ).
> LASMIDITAN is an in vitro inhibitor of P -glycoprotein (P -gp) and breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP). In a drug interaction study, LASMIDITAN increased the systemic exposure of coadministered DABIGATRAN (P-gp substrate) by approximately 25% . Therefore , when RAYVOW is administered with P -gp substrates that have  a narrow therapeutic index  (such as DIGOXIN) , increases in the systemic exposure of the coadministered medication  may be clinically meaningful  (see section 5.2) . In the same study, no significant change in ROSUVASTATIN (BCRP subst rate) PK was observed when it was coadministered with LASMIDITAN.
