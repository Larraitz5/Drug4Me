> Immunosuppressive medicinal products Combination with biologic al DMARDs, biologic al immunomodulators  or other JAK INHIBITORS has not been studied. In rheumatoid arthritis  and juvenile idiopathic arthritis , use of baricitinib with potent immunosuppressive medicinal products such as AZATHIOPRINE, TACROLIMUS, or CICLOSPORIN was limited in clinical studies, and a risk of additive immunosuppression cannot be excluded.  In atopic dermatitis  and alopecia areata, c ombination with CICLOSPORIN or other potent IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS has not been studied and is not recommended (see section  4.4).
> Transporters  In vitro , baricitinib is a substrate for organi c anionic transporter (OAT)3, P -glycoprotein (Pgp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and multidrug and toxic extrusion protein (MATE)2-K. In a clinical pharmacology study, dosing of PROBENECID (an OAT3 inhibitor with strong inhibition potential ) resulted in approximately a 2-fold increase in AUC (0-âˆž) with no change in t max or C max of baricitinib. Consequently, in patients taking OAT3 inhibitors with a strong inhibition potential, such as PROBENECID, the recommended dose of baricitinib should be reduced by half  (see section  4.2). No clinical pharmacology study has been conducted with OAT3 inhibitors with less inhibition potential. The prodrug LEFLUNOMIDE rapidly converts to TERIFLUNOMIDE which is a weak OAT3 inhibitor and therefore may lead to an increase in baricitinib exposure. S ince dedicated interaction studies have not been conducted, caution should be used when LEFLUNOMIDE or TERIFLUNOMIDE  are given concomitantly  10 with baricitinib . Concomitant use of the OAT3  inhibitors IBUPROFEN and DICLOFENAC may lead to increased exposure of baricitinib, however their inhibition potential of OAT3 is less compared to PROBENECID and thus a clinically relevant interaction is not expected . Coadministration of baricitinib with c iclosporin (Pgp/BCRP inhibitor) or METHOTREXATE (substrate of several transporters including OATP1B1, OAT1, OAT3, BCRP, MRP2, MRP3, and MRP4) resulted in no clinically meaningful effects on baricitinib exposure.
