> Tpa -IPV followed by CERVARIX one month later tended to elicit lower anti -HPV- 16 and anti -HPV- 18 GMTs as compared to CERVARIX alone. The clinical relevance of this observation is not known.  CERVARIX may also be administered concomitantly with meningococcal serogroups A, C, W -135, Y TETANUS TOXOID conjugate vaccine (Men
> DNA) vaccine ( Engerix B ). 5 Administration of CERVARIX at the same time as Twinrix has shown no clinically relevant interference in the antibody response to the HPV and hepatitis A antigens. Anti -HBs geometric mean antibody concentrations were significantly lower on co- administration , but the clinical relevance of this observation is not known since the seroprotection rates remain unaffected. The proportion of subjects reaching anti -HBs ≥ 10m
> IU/ml was 98.3% for concomitant vaccination and 100% for Twinrix given alone. Similar results were observed when CERVARIX was given concomitantly with Engerix B with 
97.9% of subjects reaching anti -HBs ≥  10m
