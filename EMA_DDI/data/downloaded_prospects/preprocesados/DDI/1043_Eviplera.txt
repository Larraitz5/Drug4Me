> Co-administration of EVIPLERA and medicinal products that induce CYP3A has been observed to decrease the plasma concentrations of RILPIVIRINE which could potentially lead to loss of therapeutic effect of EVIPLERA (see section  4.3).

> Renally eliminated medicinal products  Since EMTRICITABINE and TENOFOVIR are primarily eliminated by the kidneys, co -administration of EVIPLERA with medicinal products that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion (e.g. CIDOFOVIR) may increase serum concentrations of EMTRICITABINE, TENOFOVIR and/or the co-administered medicinal products. 
> Use of EVIPLERA should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic medicinal product.  Some examples include, but are not limited to, aminoglycosides, amphotericin  B, FOSCARNET, GANCICLOVIR, PENTAMIDINE, VANCOMYCIN, CIDOFOVIR or interleukin-2 (also called ALDESLEUKIN). 
> Cytochrome P450 ENZYME INHIBITORS  Co-administration of EVIPLERA with medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A enzyme activity has been observed to increase RILPIVIRINE plasma concentrations. 
> P-glycoprotein substrates RILPIVIRINE inhibits P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in vitro  (IC
50 is 9.2  µM).  In a clinical study RILPIVIRINE did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of DIGOXIN.  However, it may not be completely excluded that RILPIVIRINE can increase the exposure to other medicinal products transported by P -gp that are more sensitive to intestinal P -gp inhibition (e.g. DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE).

Co-administration of EVIPLERA and DIDANOSINE is not recommended (see section  4.4).
> Increased systemic exposure to DIDANOSINE may increase DIDANOSINE related adverse reactions.  Rarely, pancreatitis and lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, have been reported.  Co-administration of TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL and DIDANOSINE at a dose of 400  mg daily  has been associated with a significant decrease in CD4+ cell count, possibly due to an intracellular interaction increasing phosphorylated (i.e. active) DIDANOSINE.  A decreased dosage of 250 mg DIDANOSINE co-administered with TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL therapy  has been associated with reports of high rates of virological failure within several tested combinations for the treatment of HIV -1 infection.
