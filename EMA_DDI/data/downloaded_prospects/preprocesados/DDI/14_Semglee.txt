> Substances that may enhance the blood -GLUCOSE- lowering effect and increase susceptibility to hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, DISOPYRAMIDE, FIBRATES, FLUOXETINE, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, PENTOXIFYLLINE, PROPOXYPHENE, salicylates and sulfonamide ANTIBIOTICS.
> Subst ances that may reduce the blood -GLUCOSE- lowering effect include CORTICOSTEROIDS, DANAZOL, DIAZOXIDE, DIURETICS, GLUCAGON, ISONIAZID, oestrogens and PROGESTOGENS, PHENOTHIAZINE DERIVATIVES, SOMATROPIN, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. EPINEPHRINE [adrenaline], SALBUTAMOL, TERBUTALINE), THYROID HORMONES, atypical antipsychotic medicinal products (e.g. CLOZAPINE and OLANZAPINE) and PROTEASE INHIBITORS.
> Beta-blockers, CLONIDINE, LITHIUM salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-GLUCOSE- lowering effect of insulin. PENTAMIDINE may cause hypoglycaemia, which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.
