> The information in this section is based on binding affinity between SUGAMMADEX  and other medicinal products, non- clinical exper iments,  clinical studies  and simulations using a model taking into account the pharm acodynam ic effect of neuromuscular blocking agents and the phar macokinetic interaction between  neuromuscular blocking agents and SUGAMMADEX. Based on these data, no clinical ly significant pharmacodynam ic interaction with other medicinal products is expec ted, with  exception of the following: For TOREMIFENE and FUSIDIC ACID displacement interactions could not be exclude d (no clinica lly relevant 7
> Due to the administrati on of SUGAMMADEX, certai n medicinal products could become less effective due to a lowering of the (free) plasma concentrations. If such a situation is observed, the cl inician is advised to consider the re- administration of the medicinal product, the admini stration of a therapeutical ly equivalen t medicinal product (preferably from a different chemical class) and/or non - pharmacological interventions as appropriate. 
> Hormonal contraceptives  The interaction between 4  mg/k g suga mmade x and a progestogen was pre dicted to lead to a decrease in progestogen exposure (34 % of  AUC)  similar  to the decrease seen when  a daily dose of an oral contraceptive i s taken 12 hours too late, which might lead to a reduction in effectiveness. For oestrogens, the effect is expected to  be lower. Therefore the ad ministration of a bolus dose of SUGAMMADEX is considered to be equ ivalent to one missed daily dose of oral contraceptive steroids (either co mbined or progestogen only). If SUGAMMADEX is administ ered at t he same day as an oral contraceptive is taken reference is made to miss ed dose advice  in the package leaflet of the oral contraceptive. In the case of  non- oral hor monal contraceptives, the patient must use an additional non hormonal contraceptive method for the next 7 days and refer to the advice  in the package leaflet of the product.
