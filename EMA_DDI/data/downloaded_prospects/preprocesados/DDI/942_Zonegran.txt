> In clinical studies co -administration of LAMOTRIGINE had no apparent effect on zonisamide pharmacokinetics.  The combination of ZONEGRAN with other medicinal products that may lead to urolithiasis may enhance the risk of developing kidney stone s; therefore the concomitant administration of such medicinal products should be avoided.

- Enzyme induction : Exposure to zonisamide is lower in epileptic patients receiving CYP3A4 -inducing agents such as PHENYTOIN, CARBAMAZEPINE, and phenobarbitone. These effect s are unlikely to be of clinical significance when ZONEGRAN is added to existing therapy; however, changes in zonisamide concentrations may occur if concomitant CYP3A4 -inducing anti-epileptic or other medicinal products are withdrawn, dose adjusted or intr oduced, an adjustment of the ZONEGRAN dose may be required. Rifampicin is a potent CYP3A4 inducer. If  11 co-administration is necessary, the patient should be closely monitored and the dose of ZONEGRAN and other CYP3A4 substrates adjusted as needed.
