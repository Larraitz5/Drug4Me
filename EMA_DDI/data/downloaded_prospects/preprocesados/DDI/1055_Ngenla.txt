> Concomitant treatment with GLUCOCORTICOIDS may inhibit the grow th-promoting effects of somatrogon. Patients with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency sho uld have their glucocorticoid replacement therapy carefully adjusted to avoid any inhibitory effect on growth. Therefore, patients treated with GLUCOCORTICOIDS should have their growth monitored  carefully to assess the potential impact of glucocorticoid treatment on growth.  Growth hormone decreases the conversion of cortisone to cortiso l and may unmask previously undiscovered central hypoadrenalism or render low glucocorticoi d replacement doses ineffective (see section 4.4).
> GH) receptor agonists perform ed in growth hormone deficient children and adults, and healthy elderly men, suggest that admi nistration may increase the clearance of compounds known to be metabolised by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes , especially CYP3A. The clearance of compounds metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g. sex steroids , CORTICOSTEROIDS, anticonvulsants and CICLOSPORIN) may be increased and could result in lower exp osure of these compounds.
