> SUFENTANIL  is primarily  metabolised  by the human  cytochrome  P450 -3A4 enzyme. KETOCONAZOLE,  a potent  CYP3A4  inhibitor,  can significantly  increase  the systemic  exposure  to sublingual  SUFENTANIL  (maximal  plasma  levels  (Cmax) increase  of 19%,  overall  exposure  to the active  substance  (AUC)  increase  of 77% and prolong  the time to reach  maximum  concentration  by 41%. Similar  effects  with  other  potent  CYP3A4  inhibitors  (e. g. ITRACONAZOLE,  RITONAVIR)  cannot  be excluded.  Any change  in efficacy/tolerability  associated  with the increased  exposure  would  be compensated  in practice  by an increase  in the amount  of time between doses  (see section  4.2).
> Interaction with  CALCIUM  channel  and/or  beta blockers 
> The concomitant  use of CNS  depressants  including  barbiturates,  benzodiazepines,  neuroleptics  or other  OPIOIDS,  halogen  gases or  other  non-selective  CNS depressants  (e.g. alcohol)  may enhance respiratory depression.  The concomitant use of OPIOIDS and gabapentinoids (GABAPENTIN and PREGABALIN) increases the risk of opioid overdose, respiratory depression and death. 
> When  considering  the use of SUFENTANIL  in a patient  taking  a CNS depressant,  the duration  of use of the CNS depressant  and the patientâ€™s  response  should  be assessed,  including the degree of  tolerance  that has developed  to CNS depression.  If the decision  to begin  SUFENTANIL  is made,  the patient  should  be closely  monitored  and a lower  dose  of the concomitant  CNS depressant  should  be considered.
> Co-administration of SUFENTANIL with a serotonergic agent, such as SELECTIVE SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INHIBITORS (SSRIs), Serotonin NOREPINEPHRINE Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs), or Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAO Is), may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life threatening condition. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors must not be taken in the 2 weeks before or at the same time as DZUVEO is given.
