> With MAO INHIBITORS there have been reports of medicinal produc t interactions with the concomitant use of sympathomimetic medicinal  products. Therefore, in view o f the MAO inhibito ry activity of RASAGILINE, concomitant adminis tration of rasag iline and sympat homimetics such as those present in nasal and oral decongestants or cold medicinal products, contai ning EPHEDRINE or PSEUDOEPHEDRINE, is not recommended (see section 4.4).
> There have been reports of medicinal product interactions with the concomitant use of DEXTROMETHORPHAN and non-selective MAO INHIBITORS. Therefore, i n view of the MAO inhibitory activity of RASAGILINE,  the concomitant adm inistration of rasag iline and DEXTROMETHORPHAN is not recommended (see section 4.4).
> The concomitant use o f RASAGILINE and fluox etine or FLUVOXAMINE  should be avoided (see section 4.4).
> For concomitant use of rasagilin e with selective serotonin reup take inhibitors (SSRIs)/selective serotonin-NOREPINEPHRINE reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) in clinica l trials, see section 4.8.
> CYP1A2 inhibitors Co-administratio n of RASAGILINE and ciprof loxacin (an inhibitor  of CYP1A2) increased the AUC of RASAGILINE by 83%. Co-administra tion of RASAGILINE and theophyl line (a substrate of CYP1A2) did not 5 affect the pharmacokinetics of either product. Thus, potent CYP 1A2 inhibitors may  alter RASAGILINE plasma levels and should be administered with caution.
> CYP1A2 inducers There is a risk that the plasma levels of RASAGILINE in smoking  patients could be decreased, due to induction of the metabolising enzyme CYP1A2.
> Concomitant administration of r asagiline and ENTACAPONE increas ed RASAGILINE oral clearance by 28%.
