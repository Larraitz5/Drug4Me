> No pharmacokinetic interactions of levofloxacin were found with THEOPHYLLINE in a clinical study. However, a pronounced lowering of the cerebral seizure threshold may occur when quinolones are given concurrently with THEOPHYLLINE, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or other substances which lower the seizure threshold. Levofloxacin concentrations were about 13% higher in the presence of FENBUFEN than when administered alone. PROBENECID and CIMETIDINE
> In vitro studies demonstrated that inhibition of the key transporters associated with drug disposition in the kidney (organic anion-transporting polypeptide-1B1 (OATP1B1), OATP1B3, organic anion transporter-1 (OAT1), OAT3 and organic cationic transporter-2 (OCT2)) at exposures following inhalation of 240 mg levofloxacin twice daily is low. Furthermore, clinical data do not suggest interaction with P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates such as DIGOXIN.CICLOSPORIN
> The half-life of CICLOSPORIN was increased by 33% when coadministered with levofloxacin.VITAMIN K ANTAGONISTS
> Increased coagulation tests (PT/INR) and/or bleeding, which may be severe, have been reported in patients treated with levofloxacin in combination with a VITAMIN K antagonist (e.g. WARFARIN). Coagulation tests, therefore, should be monitored in patients treated with VITAMIN K ANTAGONISTS (see section 4.4).8Active substances known to prolong the QT interval
