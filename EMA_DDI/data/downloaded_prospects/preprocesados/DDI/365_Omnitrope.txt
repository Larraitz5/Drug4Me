> Concomitant treatment with GLUCOCORTICOIDS inhibits the growth-promoting effects of OMNITROPE. Patients with ACTH deficiency should have their glucocorticoid replacement therapy carefully adjusted to avoid any inhibitory effect on growth.8Growth hormone decreases the conversion of cortisone to cortisol and may unmask previously undiscovered central hypoadrenalism or render low glucocorticoid replacement doses ineffective (see section 4.4).In women on oral oestrogen replacement, a higher dose of growth hormone may be required to achieve the treatment goal (see section 4.4).Data from an interaction study performed in growth hormone deficient adults suggests that somatropin administration may increase the clearance of compounds known to be metabolised by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. The clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4 (e.g. sex steroids, CORTICOSTEROIDS, anticonvulsants and CICLOSPORIN) may be especially increased resulting in lower plasma levels of these compounds. The clinical significance of this is unknown.Also see section 4.4 for statements regarding diabetes mellitus and THYROID disorder and section 4.2 for statement on oral oestrogen replacement therapy.
