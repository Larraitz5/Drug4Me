> Deferasirox metabolism depends on U GT ENZYMES. In a hea lthy volunteer s tudy, the concom itant administration of  deferasirox  (single dose of  30 m g/kg, dispers ible tablet formulation) and t he potent UGT  inducer, rifa mpicin, (repea ted dose of  600 mg/day) resulted i n a dec rease of def erasirox exposure by 44% (90% CI: 37% - 51%). T herefore, t he conco mitant use of deferasirox w ith potent UGT inducers (e.g. rifa mpicin, carba mazepine, phen ytoin, phenobarbita l, ritona vir) m ay result  in a decrease in deferasirox efficacy . The patien tâ€™s ser um ferritin shou ld be monitored d uring and after  the co mbination, and the dose of  deferasirox adjusted if necessar y.
> In a hea lthy volunteer s tudy, the conco mitant administration of  deferasirox  as a C YP1A2 inhibitor (repeat ed dose of 30 mg/kg/da y, dispers ible tablet formulation) and t he CYP1A2 substra te theophy lline ( single dose of  120 mg) resulted i n an i ncrease of theoph ylline A UC by 84% (90% C I: 
73% to 95%). T he sin gle dose C max was not  affected, but  an increase of theophy lline C max is expected to occur with ch ronic dosing . Therefore, t he concom itant use of  deferasirox  with theophy lline i s not reco mmended. I f deferasirox  and t heophy lline are used conco mitantly, monitoring  of theophy lline concen tration and theophy lline dose r eduction shoul d be cons idered. An interaction be tween de ferasirox and ot her CYP1A2 substra tes cannot  be exc luded. For substances that are predominant ly metabolised by  CYP1A2 and that have a na rrow therapeutic i ndex ( e.g. CLOZAPINE, TIZANIDINE), the sa me recommendations apply as for theophy lline. 
> Concomitant administration of deferasirox and BUSULFAN resulted in an increase of BUSULFAN exposure (AUC), but the mechanism of the interaction remains unclear. If possible, evaluation of the pharmacokinetics (AUC, clearance) of a BUSULFAN tes t dose should be performed to allow dose adjustment.
