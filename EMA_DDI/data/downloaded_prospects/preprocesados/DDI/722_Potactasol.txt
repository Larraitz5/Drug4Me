> When  combining topotecan with other chemotherapy agents, reduction of the doses of each medicinal product may be  required to improve tolerability. However, when  combining with PLATINUM agents, there is a distinct sequence- dependent interaction depending on whether the PLATINUM agent is giv en on day 1 or 5 of the topotecan dosing. If either CISPLATIN or CARBOPLATIN is given on day  1 of the topotecan dosing, a lower dose of each agent must be given to improve tolerability compared to the dose of each agent which can be given if the PLATINUM age nt is given on day  5 of the topotecan dosing.
> When topotecan (0.75 mg/m
2/day for 5 consecutive days) and CISPLATIN (60 mg/m2/day on day  1) were administered in 13 patients with ovarian cancer, a slight increase in AUC  (12 %, n = 9) and Cmax (23 %,  n = 11) was noted on day  5. This increase is considered unlikely to be of clinical relevance.
