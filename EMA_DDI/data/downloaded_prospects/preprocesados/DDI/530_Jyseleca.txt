> Filgotinib is not a clinically relevant inhibitor or inducer of most ENZYMES or transporters commonly involved in interactions such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) ENZYMES and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT).In vitro studies are inconclusive regarding the potential of filgotinib to induce CYP2B6. In vivo induction cannot be excluded.In vitro studies are inconclusive regarding the potential of filgotinib to induce or inhibit CYP1A2. No clinical studies have been performed to investigate interactions with CYP1A2 substrates and therefore the potential in vivo effect of concomitant induction and inhibition of CYP1A2 by filgotinib is unknown. Caution is recommended when filgotinib is co-administered with CYP1A2 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index.In a clinical pharmacology study, there was no effect on the pharmacokinetics of the combined contraceptive ETHINYL ESTRADIOL and LEVONORGESTREL when co-administered with filgotinib; thus no dose adjustment of oral contraceptives is required.
