[CYP450 inducer]  Significantly decreased plasma voriconazole concentrations have been reported.  If concomitant administration of voriconazole with FLUCLOXACILLIN cannot be avoided, monitor for potential loss of voriconazole effectiveness (e.g., by therapeutic drug monitoring); increasing the dose of voriconazole may be needed.  GLASDEGIB 
[CYP3A4 substrate]  Although not studied, voriconazole is likely to increase the plasma concentrations of GLASDEGIB and increase risk of QTc prolongation. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, frequent ECG monitoring is recommended (see section 4.4). Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (including but not limited to: AXITINIB, BOSUTINIB, CABOZANTINIB, CERITINIB, COBIMETINIB, DABRAFENIB, DASATINIB, NILOTINIB, SUNITINIB, IBRUTINIB, RIBOCICLIB) 
[CYP3A4 substrates]  Although not studied, voriconazole may increase plasma concentrations of tyrosine kinase inhibitors metabolised by CYP3A4. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, dose reduction of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor and close clinical monitoring is recommended (see section 
4.4).  14 Medicinal product

[CYP3A4 substrates]

 Although not studied, voriconazole is likely to significantly increase the plasma concentrations of EVEROLIMUS.
> Coadministration of voriconazole and EVEROLIMUS is not recommended because voriconazole is expected to significantly increase EVEROLIMUS concentrations (see section 4.4).
> When initiating voriconazole in patients already on CICLOSPORIN it is recommended that the CICLOSPORIN dose be halved and CICLOSPORIN level carefully monitored. Increased CICLOSPORIN levels have been associated with nephrotoxicity. When voriconazole is discontinued, CICLOSPORIN levels must be carefully monitored and the dose increased as necessary.
> When initiating voriconazole in patients already on TACROLIMUS, it is recommended that the TACROLIMUS dose be reduced to a third of the original dose and TACROLIMUS level carefully monitored. Increased TACROLIMUS levels have been associated with nephrotoxicity. When voriconazole is discontinued, TACROLIMUS levels must be carefully monitored and the dose increased as necessary . Long-Acting Opiates 
[CYP3A4 substrates] 
> Other PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS that are CYP2C19 substrates may also be inhibited by voriconazole and may result in increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products. No dose adjustment of voriconazole is recommended. 
> ALFENTANIL (20 μg/kg single dose, with concomitant NALOXONE)
> 
 In an independent published study, FENTANYL AUC 0-  1.34-fold Dose reduction of ALFENTANIL, FENTANYL and other short-acting opiates similar in structure to ALFENTANIL and metabolised by CYP3A4 (SUFENTANIL) should be considered. Extended and frequent monitoring for respiratory depression and other opiate-associated adverse reactions is recommended.   Statins (e.g., LOVASTATIN)  
[CYP3A4 substrates]  Although not studied, voriconazole is likely to increase the plasma concentrations of statins that are metabolised by CYP3A4 and could lead to rhabdomyolysis.  If concomitant administration of voriconazole with statins metabolised by CYP3A4 cannot be avoided, dose reduction of the statin should be considered.  SULFONYLUREAS (including but not limited to: TOLBUTAMIDE, GLIPIZIDE, GLYBURIDE) 
[CYP2C9 substrates]  Although not studied, voriconazole is likely to increase the plasma concentrations of SULFONYLUREAS and cause hypoglycaemia.  Careful monitoring of blood GLUCOSE is recommended. Dose reduction of SULFONYLUREAS should be considered.   17 Medicinal product 
[Mechanism of interaction]  Interaction Geometric mean changes (%) Recommendations concerning coadministration Vinca Alkaloids (including but not limited to: VINCRISTINE and VINBLASTINE) 
[CYP3A4 substrates]  Although not studied, voriconazole is likely to increase the plasma concentrations of vinca alkaloids and lead to neurotoxicity.  Dose reduction of vinca alkaloids should be considered. Other HIV PROTEASE INHIBITORS (including but not limited to: SAQUINAVIR, AMPRENAVIR and NELFINAVIR)* 
[CYP3A4 substrates and inhibitors]  Not studied clinically. In vitro studies show that voriconazole may inhibit the metabolism of HIV PROTEASE INHIBITORS and the metabolism of voriconazole may also be inhibited by HIV PROTEASE INHIBITORS.  Careful monitoring for any occurrence of drug toxicity and/or lack of efficacy, and dose adjustment may be needed. Other NON-NUCLEOSIDE REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE INHIBITORS (NNRTIs) (including but not limited to: DELAVIRDINE, NEVIRAPINE)* 
[CYP3A4 substrates, inhibitors or CYP450 inducers]  Not studied clinically.  In vitro studies show that the metabolism of voriconazole may be inhibited by NNRTIs and voriconazole may inhibit the metabolism of NNRTIs.  The findings of the effect of EFAVIRENZ on voriconazole suggest that the metabolism of voriconazole may be induced by an NN RTI. Careful monitoring for any occurrence of drug toxicity and/or lack of efficacy, and dose adjustment may be needed. TRETINOIN 
[CYP3A4 substrate]  Although not studied, voriconazole may increase TRETINOIN concentrations and increase risk of adverse reactions (pseudotumor cerebri, hypercalcaemia).  Dose adjustment of TRETINOIN is recommended during treatment with voriconazole and after its discontinuation. CIMETIDINE (400 mg BID) 
[non-specific CYP450 inhibitor and increases gastric p
