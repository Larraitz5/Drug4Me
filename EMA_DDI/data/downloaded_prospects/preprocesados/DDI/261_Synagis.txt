> No formal interactions studies with other medicinal products were conducted .  In the phase III IMpact -RSV study in the premature and bronchop ulmonary dysplasia paediatric populations, the proportions of patients in the placebo and palivizumab groups who received routine childhood VACCINES, influenza 4vaccine, bronchodilators or CORTICOSTEROIDS we re similar and no incremental increase in adverse reactions was observed among patients receiving these agents.Since the monoclonal antibody is specific for RSV, palivizumab is not expected to interfere with the immune response to VACCINES.Palivizuma b may interfere with immune -based RSV diagnostic tes ts, such as some antigen detectionbased assays.  In addition, palivizumab inhibits virus replication in cell culture and, therefore, mayalso interfere with viral culture assays.  Palivizumab does not interfere with reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction -based assays.  Assay interference could lead to false -negative RSVdiagnostic test results.  Therefore, diagnostic test results, when obtained, should be used in conjunction with clinical findings to guide medical decisions.
