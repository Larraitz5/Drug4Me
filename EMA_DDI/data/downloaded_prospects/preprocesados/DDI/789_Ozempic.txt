> Semaglutide is not anticipated to decrease the ef fect of oral contraceptives  as semaglutide did not change the overal l exposure of ethinylestradiol and LEVONORGESTREL to a clinically relevant degree when an oral contraceptive combination medicinal product  (0.03 mg ethinylestradiol/0.15 mg LEVONORGESTREL) was co -administered with semaglutide.  Exposure of ethinylestradiol was  not affected; an increase of 20 % was observed for LEVONORGESTREL exposure at steady state. Cmax was not affected for any of the compounds .
> Semaglutide did not change the overall exposure of ATORVASTATIN following a single dose administration of ATORVASTATIN (40  mg). ATORVASTATIN Cmax was decreased by 38%. This was assessed not to be clinically relevant. 
> Semaglutide did not change the overall exposure or Cmax of R- and S -WARFARIN following a single dose of WARFARIN (25  mg), and the pharmacodynamic effects of WARFARIN as measured by the international normalised ratio  (INR) were not affected in a clinically relevant manner . However, cases of decreased INR have been reported during concomitant use of ACENOCOUMAROL and semaglutide. U pon initiation of semaglutide treatment in patients on WARFARIN or other COUMARIN derivatives, frequent monitoring of INR is recommended.
