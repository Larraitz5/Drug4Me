> As EFAVIRENZ/ EMTRICITABINE/ TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL contains EFAVIRENZ, EMTRICITABINE and TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL, any interactions that have been identified with these agents individually may occur with 10efavirenz/ EMTRICITABINE/ TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL. Inter action studies with these agents have only been performed in adults.As a fixed combination, EFAVIRENZ/ EMTRICITABINE/ TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL should not be administered concomitantly with other medicinal products containing the components, EMTRICITABINE or te nofovir disoproxil. EFAVIRENZ/ EMTRICITABINE/ TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL should not be co -administered with products containing EFAVIRENZ unless needed for dose adjustment e.g. with rifampicin (see section 4.2). Due to similarities with EMTRICITABINE, EFAVIRENZ/ EMTRICITABINE/ TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL should not be administered concomitantly with other cytidine analogues, such as LAMIVUDINE. EFAVIRENZ/ EMTRICITABINE/ TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL should not be administered concomitantly with ADEFOVIR DIPIVOXIL or with medicinal products containing TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE.EFAVIRENZ is an in vivo inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and UGT1A1. Compounds that are substrates of these ENZYMES may have decreased plasma concentrations when co -administered with EFAVIRENZ. EFAVIRENZ may be an inducer of CYP2C19 and CYP2C9; however, inhibition has also been observed in vitro and the net effect of co -administration with substrates of these ENZYMES is not clear (see section 5.2).EFAVIRENZ exposure may be increased when given with medicinal products (fo r example RITONAVIR) or food (for example, GRAPEFRUIT JUICE) which inhibit CYP3A4 or CYP2B6 activity. Compounds or herbal preparations (for example GINKGO BILOBA extracts and St. John’s wort) which induce these ENZYMES may give rise to decreased plasma con centrations of EFAVIRENZ. Concomitant use of St. John’s wort is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Concomitant use of GINKGO BILOBA extracts is not recommended (see section 4.4).In vitro and clinical pharmacokinetic interaction studies have shown the pot ential for CYP -mediated interactions involving EMTRICITABINE and TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL with other medicinal products is low.Cannabinoid test interaction
> Co-administration of EFAVIRENZ/ EMTRICITABINE/ TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL with ELBASVIR/GRAZOPREVIR is contraindicated because it may lead to loss of virologic response to ELBASVIR/GRAZOPREVIR (seesection 4.3 and Table 1).VORICONAZOLE
> Co-administration of standard doses of EFAVIRENZ and VORICONAZOLE is contraindicated. Since EFAVIRENZ/ EMTRICITABINE/ TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL is a fixed -dose combination product, the dose of EFAVIRENZ cannot be altered; therefore, VORICONAZOLE and EFAVIRENZ/ EMTRICITABINE/ TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL must not be co-administered (see section 4.3 and Table 1).St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum)Co-administration of EFAVIRENZ/ EMTRICITABINE/ TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL and St. John’s wort or herbal preparations containing St. John’s wort is contraindicated. Plasma levels of EFAVIRENZ can be reduced 11by concomitant use of St. John’s wort due to induction of active substance metabolising ENZYMES and/or transport proteins by St. John’s wort. If a patient is already taking St. John’s wort, stop St. John’s wort, check viral levels and if possible EFAVIRENZ levels. EFAVIRENZ levels may increase on stopping St. John’s wo rt. The inducing effect of St. John’s wort may persist for at least 2 weeks after cessation of treatment (see section 4.3).METAMIZOLE
> Co-administration of EFAVIRENZ with METAMIZOLE, which is an inducer of metabolising ENZYMES including CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 may cause a reduction in plasma concentrations of EFAVIRENZ with potential decrease in clinical efficacy. Therefore, caution is advised when METAMIZOLE and EFAVIRENZ are administered concurrently; clinical response and/or active substance levels should be monitored as appropriate.QT Prolonging medicinal products
> EFAVIRENZ/ EMTRICITABINE/ TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL is contraindicated with concomi tant use of medicinal products that are known to prolong the QTc interval and could lead to Torsade de Pointes, such as: antiarrhythmics of classes IA and III, neuroleptics and antidepressant agents, certain ANTIBIOTICS including some agents of the followi ng classes: MACROLIDES, FLUOROQUINOLONES, imidazole, and triazole antifungal agents, certain non -sedating antihistaminics (TERFENADINE, ASTEMIZOLE), CISAPRIDE, FLECAINIDE, certain ANTIMALARIALS and METHADONE (see section 4.3).Concomitant use not recommen ded
> Insufficient data are available to make a dosing recommendation for ATAZANAVIR/RITONAVIR in combination with EFAVIRENZ/EMTRICITABINE/TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL. Therefore co -administration of ATAZANAVIR/RITONAVIR and EFAVIRENZ/ EMTRICITABINE/ TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL is not recommended (see Table 
1).DIDANOSINE
> Co-administration of EFAVIRENZ/ EMTRICITABINE/ TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL and DIDANOSINE is not recommended (see Table 1).SOFOSBUVIR/VELPATASVIR and SOFOSBUVIR/VELPATASVIR/VOXILAPREVIR
> Co-administration of EFAVIRENZ/ EMTRICITABINE/ TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL and SOFOSBUVIR/VELPATASVIR or SOFOSBUVIR/VELPATASVIR/VOXILAPREVIR is not recommended (see section 4.4 and Table 1).Renally eliminated medicinal products
> Since EMTRICITABINE and TENOFOVIR are primarily eliminated by the kidneys, co -administration of EFAVIRENZ/ EMTRICITABINE/ TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL with medicinal products that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion (e.g. CIDOFOVIR) may increase serum concentrations of EMTRICITABINE, TENOFOVIR and/or the co -administered medicinal products.Use of EFAVIRENZ/ EMTRICITABINE/ TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic medicinal product. Some examples include, but are not limited to, aminoglycosides, AMPHOTERICIN B, FOSCARNET, GANCICLOVIR, PENTAMIDINE, VANCOMYCIN, CIDOFOVIR or interleukin -2 (see section 4.4).PRAZIQUANTEL Concomitant use with PRAZIQUANTEL is not recommended due to significant decrease in plasma concentrations of PRAZIQUANTEL, with risk of treatment failure due to increased hepatic metabolism by EFAVIRENZ. In case the combination is needed, an increased dose of PRAZIQUANTEL could be considered.Other interactions

> NRTIs/EFAVIRENZ Specific interaction studies have not been performed with EFAVIRENZ and NRTIs other than LAMIVUDINE, ZIDOVUDINE and TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL. Clinically significant interactions have not been found and would not be expected since the NRTIs are metabolised via a different route than EFAVIRENZ and would be unlikely to compete for the same metabolic ENZYMES and elimination Due to the similarity between lamivudi ne and EMTRICITABINE, a component of EFAVIRENZ/EMTRICITABINE/TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL , EFAVIRENZ/EMTRICITABINE/TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL should not be administered concomitantly with LAMIVUDINE (see section 4.4).16pathways.NNRTIs/EFAVIRENZ Interactio n not studied. Since use of two NNRTIs proved not beneficial in terms of efficacy and safety, co -administration of EFAVIRENZ/EMTRICITABINE/TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL and another NNRTI is not recommended.DIDANOSINE/TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL Co-administration of TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL and DIDANOSINE results in a 40 -60% increase in sy stemic exposure to DIDANOSINE .Co-administration of EFAVIRENZ/EMTRICITABINE/TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL and DIDANOSINE is not recommended.Increased systemic exposure to DIDANOSINE may increase DIDANOSINE related adve rse reactions. Rarely, pancreatitis and lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, have been reported. Co-administration of TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL and DIDANOSINE at a dose of 400 mg daily has been associated with a significant decrease in CD4 cell count, possibly due to an intracellular interaction increasing phosphorylated (i.e. active) DIDANOSINE. A decreased dose of
