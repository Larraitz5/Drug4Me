> Based on data with another glucocorticoid (FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE), that is metabolised by CYP3A 4, coadministration  with RITONAVIR is not recommended because of the risk of increased systemic exposure of  FLUTICASONE FUROATE. 
> Caution is recommended when co -administering FLUTICASONE FUROATE with potent CYP3A inhibitors including COBICISTAT -containing products as an  increase in the risk of systemic side effects  is expected . Co-administration  should be avoided unless the benefit outweighs the increased risk of systemic  corticosteroid side effects , in which case patients should be monitored for systemic co rticosteroid side effects . In a drug interaction study of intranasal FLUTICASONE  furoate with the potent CYP3A 4 inhibitor KETOCONAZOLE there were more subjects with measurable  fluticas one furoate concentrations in the KETOCONAZOLE group (6 of the 
20 subjects) compared to placebo (1  out of 20 subjects). This small increase in exposure did not result in a statistically significant difference in 24  hour serum cortisol levels between the tw o groups .
