> PREVENAR 13 can be given concomitantly with any of the following vaccine antigens ,either as monovalent or combination VACCINES: diphtheria, tetanus, acellular or whole cell pertussis, Haemophilu s influenzae type b, inactivated poliomyelitis, hepatitis B (see section 4.4 for guidance on INFANRIX HEXA) , meningococcal serogroup C, measles, mumps, rubella ,varicella and rotavirus vaccine . PREVENAR 13 can also be given concomitantly between 12 -23 mo nths with the TETANUS TOXOID conjugated meningococcal polysaccharide serogroups A, C, W and Y vaccine to children who have been adequately primed with PREVENAR 13 (as per local recommendations) .Data from a postmarketing clinical study evaluating the impa ct of prophylactic use of antipyretics (IBUPROFEN and paracetamol) on the immune response to PREVENAR 13 suggest that administration of paracetamol concomitantly or within the same day of vaccination may reduce the immune response to PREVENAR 13 after the infant series. Responses to the booster dose administered at 12 months were unaffected. The clinical significance of this observation is unknown.Children and adolescents 6 to 17 years of age
> No data are currently available regarding concomitant use with OTHER VACCINES. Adults 18 to 49 years of age
> No data are available regarding concomitant use with OTHER VACCINES. Adults aged50years and older
> PREVENAR 13 may be administered concomitantly with the seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV).In two studies conducted in adults aged 50 -59 and 65 years and older, it was demonstrated that PREVENAR 13 may be given concomitantly with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV). The responses to all three TIV antigens were comparable when T IV was given alone or concomitantly with PREVENAR 13.When PREVENAR 13 was given concomitantly with TIV, the immune responses to PREVENAR 13 were lower compared to when PREVENAR 13 was given alone , however, there was no long -term impact on circulating ant ibody levels .7In a third study in adults aged 50 -93 years ,it was demonstrated that PREVENAR 13 may be given concomitantly with the seasonal quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (QIV). The immune responses to all four QIV strains were noninferior when PREVENAR 13 was given concomitantly with QIV compared to when QIV was given alone.The immune responses to PREVENAR 13 were noninferior when PREVENAR 13 was given concomitantly with QIV compared to when PREVENAR 13 was given alone. As with concomitant administration with trivalent VACCINES, immune responses to some pneumococcal serotypes were lower when both VACCINES were given concomitantly .Concomitant use with OTHER VACCINES has not been investigated.Different injectable VACCINES should always be given at different vaccination sites.Concomitant administration of PREVENAR 13 and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine has not been studied. In clinical studies when PREVENAR 13 was given 1 year after 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vacci ne the immune responses were lower for all serotypes compared to when PREVENAR 13 was given to subjects not previously immuni sed with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine .The clinical significance of this is unknown.
