> No interaction studies have been performed with TECVAYLI.The initial release of cytokines associated with the start of TECVAYLI treatment could suppress CYP450 ENZYMES. The highest risk of interaction is expected to be from initiation of TECVAYLI step-up schedule up to 7 days after the first maintenance dose or during a CRS event. During this time period, toxicity or medicinal product concentrations (e.g., CYCLOSPORINE) should be monitored in patients who are receiving concomitant CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index. The dose of the concomitant medicinal product should be adjusted as needed.14
