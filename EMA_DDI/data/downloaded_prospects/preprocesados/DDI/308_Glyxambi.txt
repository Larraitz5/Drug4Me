> Insulin an d sulphonylureas may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or sulphonylureas may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with GLYXAMBI (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8).DIURETICS
> EMPAGLIFLOZIN may add to the diuretic effect of thiazide and LOOP DIURETICS and may increase the risk of dehydration and hypotension (see section 4.4).Pharmacokinetic interactions
> EMPAGLIFLOZIN is mainly excreted unchanged. A minor fraction is metabolised via URIDINE 5' -diphosphoglucuronosyltransferases (UGT); therefore , a clinically relevant effect of UGT inhibitors on EMPAGLIFLOZIN is not expected (see section 5.2). The effect of UGT induction on EMPAGLIFLOZIN (e.g. induction by rifampicin or PHENYTOIN) has not been studied. Co -treatment with known inducers of UGT ENZYMES is not recommended due to a potential risk of decreased efficacy of EMPAGLIFLOZIN. If an inducer of these UGT ENZYMES must be co -administered, monitoring of glycaemic control to assess response to GLYXAMBI is appropriate.Co-administration of EMPAGLIFLOZIN with PROBENECID, an inh ibitor of UGT ENZYMES and OAT3, resulted in a 26 %increase in peak EMPAGLIFLOZIN plasma concentratio ns (Cmax) and a 53 %increase in 8area under the concentration -time curve (AUC). These changes were not considered to be clinically meaningful.An interaction study with GEMFIBROZIL, an in vitro inhibitor of OAT3 and OATP1B1 /1B3 transporters, showed that empag liflozin C maxincreased by 15 %and
> AUC increased by 59 %following co -administration. These changes were not considered to be clinically meaningful.Inhibition of OATP1B1/1B3 transporters by co -administration wi th rifampicin resulted in a 75 %increase in C maxand a 35 %increase in AUC of EMPAGLIFLOZIN. These changes were not considered to be clinically meaningful.Interaction studies suggest that the pharmacokinetics of EMPAGLIFLOZIN were not influenced by co -administration with METFORMIN, GLIMEPIRIDE, PIOGLITAZONE, SITAGLIPTIN, LINAGLIPTIN, WARFARIN, VERAPAMIL, RAMIPRIL, SIMVASTATIN, TORASEMIDE andhydrochlorothiazide.Effects of EMPAGLIFLOZIN on other medicinal products
> EMPAGLIFLOZIN may increase renal LITHIUM excretion and the blood LITHIUM levels m ay be decreased. Serum concentration of LITHIUM should be monitored more frequently after EMPAGLIFLOZIN initiation and dose changes. Please refer the patient to the LITHIUM prescribing doctor in order to monitor serum concentration of LITHIUM.Interaction studies conducted in healthy volunteers suggest that EMPAGLIFLOZIN had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of METFORMIN, GLIMEPIRIDE, PIOGLITAZONE, SITAGLIPTIN, LINAGLIPTIN,  SIMVASTATIN, WARFARIN, RAMIPRIL, DIGOXIN, DIURETICS and oral contraceptives.Effects of other medicinal products on LINAGLIPTIN
> Co-administration of rifampicin decreased LINAGLIPTIN exposure by 40 %, suggesting that the efficacy of LINAGLIPTIN may be reduced when administered in combination with a strong P-glycoprotein (P -gp) or cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozyme CYP3A4 inducer, particularly if these are administed long -term (see section 5.2). Co-administration with other potent inducers of P -gp and CYP3A4, such as CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENOBARBITAL and PHENYTOIN, ha s not been studied.Co-administration of a single 5 mg oral dose of LINAGLIPTIN and multiple 200 mg oral doses of RITONAVIR, a potent inhibitor of P -glycoprotein and CYP3A4, in creased the AUC and C maxof LINAGLIPTIN approximately twofold and threefold, re spectively .The un bound concentrations, which are usually less than 1 %at the therapeutic dose of LINAGLIPTIN, were increased 4to 5-fold after co -administration with RITONAVIR . Simulations of steady -state plasma concent rations of LINAGLIPTIN with and without RITONAVIR indicated that the increase in exposure will be n ot associated with an increased accumulation. These changes in LINAGLIPTIN pharmacokinetics were not considered to be clinically relevant. Therefore, clinica lly relevant interactions would not be exp ected with other P -glycoprotein/ CYP3A4 inhibitors.Interaction studies conducted in healthy volunteers suggest that the pharmacokinetics of LINAGLIPTIN were not influenced by co -administration with METFORMIN and g libenclamide.Effects of LINAGLIPTIN on other medicinal products
