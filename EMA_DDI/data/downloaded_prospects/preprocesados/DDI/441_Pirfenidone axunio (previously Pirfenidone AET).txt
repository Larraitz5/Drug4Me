> In a Phase 1 study, the co -administration of pirfenidone and FLUVOXAMINE (a strong inhibitor of CYP1A2 with inhibitory effects on other CYP isoenzymes [CYP2C9, 2C19, and 2D6]) resulted in a 4 -fold increase in exposure to pirfenidone in non -smokers.
> Pirfenidone is contraindicated in patients with concomitant use of FLUVOXAMINE (see section 4.3). FLUVOXAMINE should be discontinued prior to the initiation of pirfenidone therapy and avoided during pirfenidone therapy due to the reduced clearance of pirfenidone. Other therapies that are inhibitors of both CYP1A2 and one or more other CYP isoenzymes involved in the metabolism of pirfenidone  (e.g. CYP2C9, 2C19, and 2D6) should be avoided during pirfenidone treatment. 
> In vitro and in vivo extrapolations indicate that strong and selective inhibitors of CYP1A2 (e.g. ENOXACIN) have the potential to increase the exposure to pirfenidone by approximately 2 to 4 -fold. If concomitant use of pirfenidone with a strong and selective inhibitor of CYP1A2 cannot be avoided, the dose of pirfenidone should be reduced to 801 mg daily (267 mg, three times a day). Patients should be closely monitored for emergence of adverse reactions associated with pirfenidone therapy. Discontinue pirfenidone if necessary (see sections 4.2 and  4.4).
> Co-administration of pirfenidone and 750 mg of CIPROFLOXACIN (a moderate inhibitor of CYP1A2) increased the exposure to pirfenidone by 81%. If CIPROFLOXACIN at the dose of 750 mg two times a day cannot be avoided, the dose of pirfenidone should be reduced to 1602 mg daily (534 mg, three times a day). Pirfenidone should be used with caution when CIPROFLOXACIN is used at a dose of 250 mg or 
500 mg once or two times a day. 
> In the case of moderate inducers of CYP1A2 (e.g. OMEPRAZOLE), concomitant use may theoretically result in a lowering of pirfenidone plasma levels.
