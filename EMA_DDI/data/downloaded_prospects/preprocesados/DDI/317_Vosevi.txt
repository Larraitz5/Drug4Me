> VELPATASVIR  and VOXILAPREVIR are  inhibitor s of drug transporter s P-gp, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion- transporting polypeptide ( OATP ) 1B1 and OATP1B3. Co -administration of VOSEVI  with medicinal products that are substrates of these transporters  may increase the exposure of such medicinal products . Medic inal products that are sensitive substrates of these transporters and for which elevated plasma levels are associated with serious event s are contraindicated (see Table 2). DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE (P -gp substrate) and ROSUVASTATIN (OATP1B and BCRP subst rate) are contraindicated (see s ection  4.3 and Table  2). 
> Medicinal products that may decrease plasma exposure of VOSEVI  Medicinal products that are strong inducers of P -gp and/or strong inducers of CYP2B6, CYP2C8, or CYP3A4 (e.g. CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENOBARBITAL, PHENYTOIN, rifampicin, RIFABUTIN and St. John’s wort)  may decrease plasma concentrations of SOFOSBUVIR , VELPATASVIR and/or VOXILAPREVIR  leading to reduced therapeutic effect of VOSEVI . The use of such medicinal products with VOSEVI  is contraindicated (see section  4.3 and Table 2).
> Medicinal products that are moderate P -gp inducers and/or moderate CYP inducers (e.g. EFAVIRENZ, MODAFINIL , OXCARBAZEPINE or RIFAPENTINE ) may decrease SOFOSBUVIR , VELPATASVIR and/or VOXILAPREVIR plasma concentrations  leading to reduced therapeutic effect of VOSEVI . Co-administration with such medicinal products is not recommended with VOSEVI  (see section  4.4 and Table  2).
> Medicinal products that may increase plasma exposure of VOSEVI  Co-administration with medicinal products that inhibit P -gp or BCRP may increase SOFOSBUVIR , VELPATASVIR  or VOXILAPREVIR  plasma concentrations . Medicinal products that inhibit  OATP 1B, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, or CYP3A4 may increase plasma concentration s of VELPATASVIR  or VOXILAPREVIR . The use of strong inhibitors of OATP 1B (e.g. CICLOSPORIN)  with VOSEVI  is not recommended  (see section  4.4 and Table  2). Clinically significant medicinal product interactions with VOSEVI  mediated by P-gp, BCRP  and CYP  inhibitors  are not expected . VOSEVI  may be c o-admi nistered with P -gp, BCRP  and CYP inhibitors.
