> In clinical studies, ZOLEDRONIC ACID has been administered concomitantly with commonly used anticancer agents, DIURETICS, ANTIBIOTICS and ANALGESICS without clinically apparent  interactions occurring. ZOLEDRONIC ACID shows no appreciable binding to plasma proteins and does not inhibit human P450 ENZYMES in vitro  (see section 5.2), but no formal clinical interaction studies have been performed.   Caution is advised when bisphosph onates are administered with aminoglycosides, calcitonin or LOOP DIURETICS, since these  agents may have an additive effect, resulting in a lower serum CALCIUM level for longer periods than required (see section 4.4).
> In multiple myeloma patients, the risk of renal dysfunction may be increased when zoledroni c acid is  used in combination with THALIDOMIDE.
> Caution is advised when ZOLEDRONIC ACID is administered with anti- angiogenic medicinal products, as an increase in the incidence of ONJ has been observed in patients treated concomitantly with these medicinal products.
