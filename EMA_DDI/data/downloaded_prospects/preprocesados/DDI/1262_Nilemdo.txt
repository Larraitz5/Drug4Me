> PROBENECID  PROBENECID, an inhibitor of glucuronid e conjugation, was studied to evaluate the potential effect of these inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of BEMPEDOIC ACID.  Administration of BEMPEDOIC ACID 
180 mg with steady -state PROBENECID resulted in a 1 .7-fold increase in bempedoic ac id area under the curve  (AUC ) and a 1.9 -fold increase in  BEMPEDOIC ACID active metabolite ( ESP15228 ) AUC . These elevations are not clinically meaningful and do not imp act dosing recommendations. 
> Statins  The pharmacokinetic interactions between BEMPEDOIC ACID 180  mg and SIMVASTATIN 40  mg, ATORVASTATIN 80  mg, PRAVASTATIN 80  mg, and ROSUVASTATIN 40  mg were evaluated in clinical trials.  Administration of a single dose of SIMVASTATIN 40  mg with steady -state BEMPEDOIC ACID 180  mg resulted in a 2 -fold increase in SIMVASTATIN acid exposure. Elevations of 1.4 -fold to 1.5 -fold in AUC of ATORVASTATIN, PRAVASTATIN, and ROSUVASTATIN (administered as single doses) and/or their major  metabolites were observed when coadministered with BEMPEDOIC ACID 180  mg. Higher elevations have been observed when these statins were coadministered with a supratherapeutic 240  mg dose of BEMPEDOIC ACID (see section 4.4). 
> Transporter -mediated drug inter actions  BEMPEDOIC ACID and its glucuronide weakly inhibit OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 at clinically relevant concentrations. Coadministration of BEMPEDOIC ACID  with medicinal products that are substrates of OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 (i.e., BOSENTAN, fimasartan, asunaprev ir, GLECAPREVIR, GRAZOPREVIR, VOXILAPREVIR, and statins such as ATORVASTATIN, PRAVASTATIN, FLUVASTATIN, PITAVASTATIN, ROSUVASTATIN, and SIMVASTATIN [see section 4.4]) may result in increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products. 
> BEMPEDOIC ACID inhibits OAT2 in vitro , which may be the mechanism responsible for minor elevations in serum creatinine and uric acid (see section 4.8). Inhibition of OAT2 by BEMPEDOIC ACID may also potentially increase plasma concentrations of  medicinal products that are substrates of OAT2. BEMPEDOIC ACID may also weakly inhibit OAT3 at clinically relevant concentrations. 
> EZETIMIBE  Total EZETIMIBE (EZETIMIBE and its glucuronide form) and EZETIMIBE glucuronide AUC and C max increased approximately 1 .6- and 1.8 -fold, respectively, when a single dose of EZETIMIBE was taken with steady -state BEMPEDOIC ACID. This increase is likely  due to inhibition of OATP1B1 by BEMPEDOIC ACID, which results in decrease d hepatic uptake and subsequently  decreased  elimination of EZETIMIBE -glucuronide . Increases in AU C and C max for EZETIMIBE were less than 20% . These elevations are not clinically meaningful and do not impact dosing recommendations.
