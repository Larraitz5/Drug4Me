> Strong and moderate CYP3A4 inducers  Co-administration of 600 mg once daily RIFAMPIN, a strong CYP3A inducer, for 7 days with a single oral 25 m g duvelisib dose in healthy adults (N = 13) decreased duvelisib C max by 66% and AUC by 
82%.  Co-administration with a strong CYP3A inducer decreases duvelisib area under the curve (AUC) (see section 5.2 ), which may reduce duvelisib efficacy. Co-administration of duvelisib with strong CYP3A4 inducers  (e.g., APALUTAMIDE, CARBAMAZEPINE, ENZALUTAMIDE, MITOTANE , PHENYTOIN, RIFAMPIN, St. John’s wort ) should be avoided . 
> Co-administration of 200 mg twice daily ETRAVIRINE, a moderate CYP3A inducer, for 10 days with a single oral 25 mg duvelisib dose in healthy adults (N = 20) decreased duvelisib C max by 16% and AUC by 35%. Co-administration of duvelisib with moderate CY P3A inducers decreases AUC of duvelisib to less than 1. 5-fold and dose reduction is not recommended . Examples  of moderate CYP3A4 inducers are BOSENTAN, EFAVIRENZ, ETRAVIRINE, PHENOBARBITAL, PRIMIDONE.    If a moderate CYP3A4 inducer must be  
8 used, the patient should be closely monitored for potential lack of efficacy. Examples:  BOSENTAN, EFAVIRENZ, ETRAVIRINE, PHENOBARBITAL, PRIMIDONE . 
> Strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors  Co-administration of a strong CYP 3A inhibitor KETOCONAZOLE (at 200 mg twice daily ( BID) for 5 days), with a single oral 10 mg dose of duvelisib in healthy adults (n= 16) increased duvelisib C max by 1.7-fold and AUC by 4 -fold. Due to time -dependent CYP3A4 auto -inhibition, duvelisib susceptibility to moderate and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is decreased under steady -state conditions.  Based on physiologically -based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling and simulation , the increase in ex posure to duvelisib is estimated to be ~1.6 -fold at steady state in cancer patients when concomitantly used with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as KETOCONAZOLE and ITRACONAZOLE . 
> CYP3A4 substrates  Co-administration of multiple doses o f duvelisib 25 mg BID for 5 days with single oral 2 mg MIDAZOLAM, a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, in healthy adults (N = 14), increased in the MIDAZOLAM AUC by 4.3 -fold and C max by 2.2-fold. PBPK simula tions in cancer patients under steady state conditions have shown that the C max and AUC of MIDAZOLAM would increase by  approximately  2.5-fold and ≥5- fold respectively.  Co -administration of MIDAZOLAM with duvelisib should be avoided.
