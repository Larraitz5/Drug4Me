> In a separate phase I study , administration of TMZ  with RANITIDINE did not result in alterations in the extent of absorption of temozolomide or the exposure to its active metabolite monomethyl triazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC).  8  Administration of TMZ with food resulted in a 33 %  decrease in C max and a 9 % decrease in area under the curve (AUC).  As it cannot be excluded that the change in C max is clinically significant, Temozolomide  Accord  should be administered without food. 
> Based on an analysis of  population pharma cokinetics in phase II trials, co -administration of DEXAMETHASONE, PROCHLORPERAZINE, PHENYTOIN, CARBAMAZEPINE, ONDANSETRON, H 2 receptor antagonists, or PHENOBARBITAL did not alter the clearance of TMZ . Co-administration with VALPROIC ACID  was associated with a small but statistically significant decrease in clearance of TMZ.
