> Due to the potential sensitivity of rapidly dividing myeloid cells to cytotoxic chemotherapyâ€š pegfilgrastim  should be administered at least 24  hours after administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy. In clinical trials, pegfilgrastim has been safely administered 14 days before chemotherapy. Concomitant use of pegfilgrastim with any chemotherapy agent has not been evaluated in patients. In animal models concomitant administration of pegfilgrastim and 5-FLUOROURACIL (5 -FU) or other ANTIMETABOLITES has been shown  to potentiate myelosuppression. 
> The potential for interaction with LITHIUM, which also promotes the release of neutrophils, has not been specifically investigated. There is no evidence that such an interaction would be harmful.
