> Fidaxomicin is a substrate of P -gp. Co -administration of single doses of the P -gp inhibitor CYCLOSPORINE A and fidaxomicin  in healthy volunteers, resulted in a 4-  and 2 -fold increase in fidaxomicin C max and AUC, respectively and in a 9.5 and 4- fold increase in C max and AUC, respectively, of  the main active metabolite OP -1118. As the clinical relevance of this increase in exposure is unclear, co -administration of potent inhibitors of P -gp, such as CYCLOSPORINE, KETOCONAZOLE, ERYTHROMYCIN, CLARITHROMYCIN, VERAPAMIL, DRONEDARONE and AMIODARONE is not recommended  (see section s 4.4 and 5.2) .
> Fidaxomicin  may be a mild to moderate inhibitor of intestinal P -gp. Fidaxomicin  (200  mg twice daily) had a small but not clinically relevant effect on DIGOXIN exposure. However, a larger effect on P -gp substrates with lower bioavailability more sensitive to intestinal P -gp inhibition such as DABIGATRAN etexilat cannot be excluded.
