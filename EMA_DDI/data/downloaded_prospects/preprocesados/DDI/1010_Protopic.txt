> Systemically available tacrolimus is metabolised via the hepatic Cytochrome P450  3A4 (CYP3A4). Systemic exposure from topical application of tacrolimus ointment is low (<1.0  ng/ml) and is unlikely to be affected by concomitant use of substances known to be inhibitors of CYP3A4. However, the possibility of interactions cannot be ruled ou t and the concomitant systemic administration of known CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ERYTHROMYCIN, ITRACONAZOLE, KETOCONAZOLE and DILTIAZEM) in patients with widespread and/or erythrodermic disease should be done with caution.
