> No formal pharmacokinetic  (PK)  drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with durvalumab.  Since the  primary elimination pathways of durvalumab are protein catabolism via reticuloendothelial system or target -mediated disposition , no metabolic drug -drug interactions are expected.  PK drug -drug interaction between durvalumab and chemotherapy  was assessed in the CASPIAN study and showed concomitant treatment with durvalumab did not impact the PK of ETOPOSIDE, CARBOPLATIN or CISPLATIN. Additionally, based on population PK analysis,  concomitant chemotherapy treatment did not  meaningfully impact the PK of durvalumab.  PK drug -drug interactions between durvalumab in combination with TREMELIMUMAB and PLATINUM -based chemotherapy were assessed in the POSEIDON study and showed no clinically meaningful PK interactions between TREMELIMUMAB, durvalumab, nab -PACLITAXEL, gemcita bine, PEMETREXED, CARBOPLATIN or CISPLATIN in the concomitant treatment.
