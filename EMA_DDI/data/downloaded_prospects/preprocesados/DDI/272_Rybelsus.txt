> THYROXINE  Total exposure (AUC) of THYROXINE (adjusted for endogenous levels) was increased by 33% following administration of a single dose of LEVOTHYROXINE. Maximum exposure (C max) was unchanged. Monitoring of THYROID parameters should be considered when treating patients with semaglutide at the same time as LEVOTHYROXINE. 
> WARFARIN  and other COUMARIN derivatives  Semaglutide did not change the AUC  or Cmax of R- and S -WARFARIN following a single dose of WARFARIN , and the pharmacodynamic effects of WARFARIN as measured by the international normalised ratio (INR) were not affected in a clinically relevant manner . However, cases of decreased INR have been reported during concomitant use of ACENOCOUMAROL and semaglutide.  Upon initiation of semaglutide treatment in patients on WARFARIN or other COUMARIN derivatives, frequent monitoring of INR is recommended. 
> ROSUVASTATIN  AUC of ROSUVASTATIN was increased by 41% [90% CI: 24; 60] when co- administered with semaglutide. Based on the wide therapeutic index of ROSUVASTATIN the magnitude of changes in the exposure i s not considered clinically relevant .
