> Increased side effects may occur in case of recent or concomitant use of hepatotoxic or haematotoxic medicinal products  or when leflunomide treatment is followed by such medicinal products  without a washout period (see also guidance concerning combination with other treatments, section  4.4). Therefore, closer monitoring of liver ENZYMES and haematological parameters is recommended in the initial phase after switching. 
> METHOTREXATE  In a small (n  = 30) study with co-administration of leflunomide (10 to 20 mg per day) with METHOTREXATE (10 to 25 mg per week) a 2 - to 3-fold elevation in liver ENZYMES was seen on 5 of 
30 patients. All elevations resolved, 2  with continuation of both medicinal products and 3 after discontinuation of leflunomide. A more than 3- fold increase was seen in another 5  patients. All of these also resolved,  2 with continuation of both medicinal products and 3 after discontinuation of leflunomide.
> WARFARIN and other COUMARIN anticoagulants There have been case reports of in creased prothrombin time, when leflunomide and WARFARIN were co-administered. A pharmacodynamics interaction with WARFARIN was observed with A771726 in a 8
> CHOLESTYRAMINE or activated charcoal It is recommended that patients receiving leflunomide are not treated with COLESTYRAMINE or activated powdered charcoal because this leads to a rapid and significant decrease in plasma A771726 (the active metabolite of leflunomide; see also section  5) conc entration. The mechanism is thought to be by interruption of enterohepatic recycling and/or gastrointestinal dialysis of A771726.  CYP450 inhibitors and inducers   In vitro  inhibition studies in human liver microsomes suggest that cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, 2C19 and 3A4 are involved in leflunomide metabolism. An in vivo interaction study with leflunomide and CIMETIDINE (non- specific weak cytochrome P450 (CYP)  inhibitor) has demonstrated a lack of a significant  impact on A771726 exposure. Following concomitant administration of a single dose of leflunomide to subjects receiving multiple doses of rifampicin (non- specific cytochrome P450 inducer) A771726 peak levels were increased by approximately 40 % , whereas the AUC was not significantly changed. Th e mechanism of this effect is unclear. 
> Effect on REPAGLINIDE (CYP2C8 substrate) There was an increase in mean REPAGLINIDE Cmax and AUC (1.7- and 2.4- fold, respectively), following repeated doses of A771726, suggesting that A771726 is an inhibitor of CYP2C8 in vivo . Therefore, monitoring patients with concomitant use of medicinal products metabolised by CYP2C8, such as REPAGLINIDE, PACLITAXEL, PIOGLITAZONE or ROSIGLITAZONE, is recommended as they may have higher exposure.  Effect on CAFFEINE (CYP1A2 substrate)  Repeated doses of A771726 decreased mean Cmax and AUC of CAFFEINE (CYP1A2 substrate) by 18 % and 55 %, respectively, suggesting that A771726 may be a weak inducer of CYP1A2 in vivo . Therefore, medicinal products metabolised by CYP1A2 (such as DULOXETINE, ALOSETRON, THEOPHYLLINE and TIZANIDINE) should be used with caution during treatment, as it could lead to the reduction of the efficacy of these products. 
> Effect on organic anion transporter 3 (OAT 3) substrates  There was an increase in mean CEFACLOR Cmax and AUC (1.43- and 1.54- fold, respectively), following repeated doses of A771726, suggesting that A771726 is an inhibitor of OAT3 in vivo . Therefore, when 9
> Effect on BCRP (Breast Cancer Resistance Protein) and/or organic anion transporting polypeptide B1 and B3 (OATP1B1/B3) substrates  There was an increase in mean ROSUVASTATIN C max and AUC (2.65- and 2.51-fold, respectively), following repeated doses of A771726. However, there was no apparent impact of this increase in plasma ROSUVASTATIN exposure on the HMG -Co
> A reductase inhibitors (e.g. SIMVASTATIN, ATORVASTATIN, PRAVASTATIN, METHOTREXATE, NATEGLINIDE, REPAGLINIDE, rifam picin) concomitant administration should also be undertaken with caution. Patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of excessive exposure to the medicinal products and reduction of the dose of these medicinal products should be considered.
> Effect on oral contraceptive (0.03 mg ethinylestradiol and 0.15 mg LEVONORGESTREL)  There was an increase in mean ethinylestradiol Cmax and AUC 0-24 (1.58- and 1.54-fold, respectively) and LEVONORGESTREL C max and AUC 0-24 (1.33- and 1.41-fold, respectively) following repeated doses of A771726. While this interaction is not expected to adversely impact the efficacy of oral contraceptives, consideration should be given to the type of oral contraceptive treatment. 
> Effect on WARFARIN (CYP2C9 substrate) Repeated doses of A771726 had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of S- WARFARIN, indicating that A771726 is not an inhibitor or an inducer of CYP2C9. However, a 25 % decrease in peak international normalised ratio (INR) was observed when A771726 was co- administered  with WARFARIN as compared with WARFARIN alone. Therefore, when WARFARIN is co- administered, close INR follow -up and monitoring is recommended.
