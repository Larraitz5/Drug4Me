- The mode of action suggests that the effects of L -dopa, dopaminergic agonists, and ANTICHOLINERGICS may be enhanced by concomitant treatment with NMDA- antagonists such as memantine. The effects of barbitur ates and neuroleptics may be reduced. Concomitant administration of memantine with the antispasmodic agents, DANTROLENE or BACLOFEN, can modify their effects and a dose adjustment may be necessary.  
- Concomitant use of memantine and AMANTADINE should be avoided, owing to the risk of pharmacotoxic psychosis. Both compounds are chemically related NMDA- antagonists. The same may be true for KETAMINE and dex tromethorphan (see also section  4.4). There is one published case report on a possible risk also for the c ombination of memantine and PHENYTOIN.  
- Other active substances such as CIMETIDINE, RANITIDINE, PROCAINAMIDE, QUINIDINE, QUININE and NICOTINE that use the same renal cationic transport system as AMANTADINE may also possibly interact with memantine leading  to a potential risk of increased plasma levels.  
- There may be a possibility of reduced serum level of HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE (HCT) when memantine is co -administered with HCT or any combination with HCT. 
- In post -marketing experience, isolated cases with in ternational normalized ratio (INR) increases have been reported in patients concomitantly treated with WARFARIN. Although no causal relationship has been established, close monitoring of prothrombin time or INR is advisable for patients concomitantly treat ed with oral anticoagulants.
