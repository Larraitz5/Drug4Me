> Oral anticoagulants  (WARFARIN),  platelet inhibitors  (acetylsalicylic  acid), NSAIDs (PIROXICAM)  and DIGOXIN did not interact with the pharmacokinetics  of fondaparinux.  The fondaparinux  dose (10 mg) in the interaction  studies was higher than the dose recommended  for the present indications.  Fondaparinux  neither influenced  the INR activity of WARFARIN, nor the bleeding time under acetylsalicylic  acid or PIROXICAM  treatment,  nor the pharmacokinetics  of DIGOXIN at steady state.
