> No formal interaction studies have been performed in humans.The interaction of AVONEX with CORTICOSTEROIDS or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has not been studied systematically. The clinical studies indicate that MS patients can receive AVONEX and CORTICOSTEROIDS or ACTH during relapses.INTERFERONS have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450-dependent ENZYMES in humans and animals. The effect of high-dose AVONEX administration on P450-dependent metabolism in monkeys was evaluated and no changes in liver metabolising capabilities were observed. Caution should be exercised when AVONEX is administered in combination with medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic cytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. some classes of ANTIEPILEPTICS and ANTIDEPRESSANTS.
