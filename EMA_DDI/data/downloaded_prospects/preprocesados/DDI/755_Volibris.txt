> Steady -state co -administration of ambrisentan and CYCLOSPORINE A resulted in a 2- fold increase in ambrisentan exposure in healthy volunteers. This may be due to the inhibiti on by CYCLOSPORINE A of transporters and metabolic ENZYMES involved in the pharmacokinetics of ambrisentan. Therefore, 7 when co- administered with CYCLOSPORINE A, the dose of ambrisentan in adult patients or paediatric patients weighing ≥50 kg should be limi ted to 5 mg once daily ; for paediatric patients ≥20 to <50 kg the dose  should be limited to 2.5 mg once daily (see section  4.2). Multiple doses of ambrisentan had no effect on CYCLOSPORINE A exposure, and no dose adjustment of CYCLOSPORINE A is warranted. 
> Co-administration of ambrisentan with a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, either SILDENAFIL or TADALAFIL (both substrates of  CYP3A4) in healthy volunteers did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor or ambrisentan (see section  5.2). 
> Steady -state administration of KETOCONAZOLE (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) did not result in a clinically significant increase in exposure to ambrisentan (see section  5.2).
