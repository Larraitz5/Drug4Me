> Ritonavir has a high affinity for several cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms and may inhibit oxidation with the following ranked ord er: CYP3A4 > CYP2D6.  Co -administration of ritonavir and medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP3A may result in increased plasma concentrations of the other medicinal product, which could increase or prolong its therapeutic and adverse effects.  For select edmedicinal products (e.g. ALPRAZOLAM) the inhibitory effects of ritonavir on CYP3A4 may decrease over time.  Ritonavir also has a high affinity for P -glycoprotein and m ay inhibit this transporter.  The inhibitory effect of ritonavir (with or wi thout other PROTEASE INHIBITORS) on P -gp activity may decrease over time ( e.g.DIGOXIN and FEXOFENADINE -see table “Ritonavir effects on non -antiretroviral medicinal products” below ).  Ritonavir may induce glucuronidation and oxidation by CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 thereby increasing the biotransformation of some medicinal products metabolised by these pathways, and may result in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could decease or shorten their therapeutic effect .  Important information regarding medicinal product interactions when ritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer is also contained in the Summary of Product Characteristics of the co-administered protease inhibitor.12Medicinal products that affect ritonavir l evels

The Summary of Product Characteristics of the co -administered protease inhibitor should be consulted for specific recommendations.  Consideration sho uld be given to official guidance on the appropriate treatment of tuberculosis in HIV -infected patients . Rifampicin Although rifampicin may induce metabolism of ritonavir, limited data indicate that when high doses of ritonavir (600 mg twice daily) is co -administered with rifampicin, the additional inducing effect of rifampicin (next to that of ritonavir itself) is small and may have no clinical relevant effect on ritonavir levels in high -dose ritonavir therapy.

> A reductase inhibitors which are highly dependent on CYP3A metabolism, such as LOVASTATIN and SIMVASTATIN, are expected to have markedly increased plasma concentrations whe n co-administered with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer.  Since increased concentrations of LOVASTATIN and SIMVASTATIN may predispose patients to myopathies, including rhabdomyolysis, the combination of these medi cinal products with ritonavir is contraindicated (see section 4.3).  ATORVASTATIN is less dependent on CYP3A for metabolism.  While ROSUVASTATIN elimination is not dependent on CYP3A, an elevation of ROSUVASTATIN exposure has been reported with ritonavir c o-administration.  The mechanism of this interaction is not clear, but may be the result of transporter inhibition. When used with ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent, the lowest possible doses of ATORVASTATIN or ro suvastatin should be administered.  The metabolism of PRAVASTATIN and FLUVASTATIN is not dependent on CYP3A, and interactions are not expected with ritonavir.  If treatment with an HMG -Co

Concomitant use of SILDENAFIL with ritonavir is contraindicated in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients (see section 4.3).TADALAFIL 20, single dose 200 q12h ↑ 124% ↔The concomitant use of TADALAFIL for the treatment of erectile dysfunction with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer should be with caution at reduced doses of no more than 10 mg TADALAFIL every 72 hours with increased monitoring for adverse reactions (see section 4.4).When TADALAFIL is used concurrently with ritonavir in patients withpulmonary arterial hypertension, refer to the TADALAFIL Summary of Product Characteristics.VARDENAFIL 5, single dose 600 q12h ↑ 49-fold ↑ 13-fold
> Concomitant use of VARDENAFIL with ritonavir is contraindicated (see section 4.3).25Ritonavir effects on Non -antiretroviral Co -administered Medicinal Products
> CLORAZEPATE, DIAZEPAM, ESTAZOLAM, FLURAZEPAM, oral and parenteral MIDAZOLAM Ritonavir co -administration is likely to result in increased plasma concentrations of CLORAZEPATE, DIAZEPAM, ESTAZOLAM and FLURAZEPAM and is therefore contraindicated (see section 4.3). MIDAZOLAM is extensively metabolised by CYP3A4.  Co -administration wi th NORVIR may cause a large increase in the concentration of this benzodiazepine.  No medicinal product interaction study has been performed for the co -administration of NORVIR with benzodiazepines.  Based on data for other CYP3A4 inhibitors, plasma concen trations of MIDAZOLAM are expected to be significantly higher when MIDAZOLAM is given orally.  Therefore, NORVIR should not be co -administered with orally administered MIDAZOLAM (see section 4.3), whereas caution should be used with co -administration of No rvir and parenteral MIDAZOLAM.  Data from concomitant use of parenteral MIDAZOLAM with other PROTEASE INHIBITORS suggest a possible 3 –4 fold increase in MIDAZOLAM plasma levels.  If NORVIR is co -administered with parenteral MIDAZOLAM, it should be done i n an intensive care unit (ICU) or similar setting which ensures close clinical monitoring and appropriate medical management in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation.  Dosage adjustment for MIDAZOLAM should be considered, especially if m ore than a single dose of MIDAZOLAM is administered.TRIAZOLAM 0.125, single dose 200, 4 doses ↑ >20 fold ↑ 87%Ritonavir co -administration is likely to result in increased plasma concentrations of TRIAZOLAM and is therefore contraindicated (see section 4.3).Pethidine Norpethidine metabolite 50, oral single dose 500 q12h ↓ 62% 
↑ 47% ↓ 59% 
↑ 87% The use of pethidine and ritonavir is contraindicated due to the increased concentrations of the metabolite, norpethidine, which has both analgesic and CNS stimulant activity.  Elevated norpethidine concentrations may increase the risk of CNS effects (e.g., seizures), see section 4.3.ALPRAZOLAM 1, single dose 200 q12h, 2 days ↑2.5 fold ↔
500 q12h, 10 days↓ 12% ↓ 16% ALPRAZOLAM metabolism was inhibited following the introduction of ritonavir.  After ritonavir use for 10 days, no inhibitory effect of ritonavir was observed.  Caution is warranted during the first several days when ALPRAZOLAM is co -administered with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer, before induction of ALPRAZOLAM metabolism develops.BUSPIRONE Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent inhibits CYP3A and as a result is expected to increase the plasma concentrations of BUSPIRONE.  Careful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is recommended when BUSPIRONE concomitantly administered with ritonavir.26Ritonavir effects on Non -antiretroviral Co -administered Medicinal Products
> BUPROPION 150 100 q12h ↓ 22% ↓ 21%
150 600 q12h ↓ 66% ↓ 62%BUPROPION is primarily metabolised by CYP2B6.  Concurrent administration of BUPROPION with repeated doses of ritonavir is expected to decrease BUPROPION levels.  These effects are thought to represent induction of BUPROPION metabolism.  How ever, because ritonavir has also been shown to inhibit CYP2B6 in vitro, the recommended dose of BUPROPION should not be exceeded.  In contrast to long -term administration of ritonavir, there was no significant interaction with BUPROPION after short -term administration of low doses of ritonavir (200 mg twice daily for 2 days), suggesting reduction s in BUPROPION concentrations may have onset several days after initiation of ritonavir co -administration.Steroids
> Systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression (plasma cortisol levels were noted to be decreased 86% in the above study ) have been reported in patients receiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasal FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE; similar effects could also occur with other co rticosteroids metabolised by CYP3A e.g., BUDESONIDE and TRIAMCINOLONE.  Consequently, concomitant administration of ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer and these GLUCOCORTICOIDS is not recommended unless the potentia l benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 4.4).  A dose reduction of the glucocorticoid should be considered with close monitoring of local and systemic effects or a switch to a glucocorticoid, which is not a substrate for CYP3A4 (e.g., BECLOMETHASONE).  Moreover, in case of withdrawal of GLUCOCORTICOIDS progressive dose reduction may be required over a longer period.   DEXAMETHASONE Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral age nt inhibits CYP3A and as a result is expected to increase the plasma concentrations of DEXAMETHASONE.  Careful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is recommended when DEXAMETHASONE is concomitantly administered with ritonavir.  PREDNISOLONE 20 200 q12h ↑ 28% ↑ 9%Careful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is recommended when PREDNISOLONE is concomitantly administered with ritonavir.  The AUC of the metabolite PREDNISOLONE increased by 37 and 28% after 4 and 14 days ritonavir, respectively.27Ritonavir effects on Non -antiretroviral Co -administered Medicinal Products
> LEVOTHYROXINE Post-marketing cases have been reported indicating a potential interaction between ritonavir containing products and LEVOTHYROXINE.  THYROID -stimulating hormone (TSH) should be monitored in patients treated with LEVOTHYROXINE at least the first month after starting and/or ending ritonavir treatment.ND: Not determined
1.Based on a parallel group comparison
2.SULFAMETHOXAZOLE was co -administered with TRIMETHOPRIM. Cardiac and neurologic events have been reported when ritonavir has been co -administered with DISOPYRAMIDE, MEXILETINE or nefaz odone.  The possibility of medicinal product interaction cannot be excluded.In addition to the interactions listed above, as ritonavir is highly protein bound, the possibility of increased therapeutic and toxic effects due to protein binding displacement of concomitant medicinal products should be considered.Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer
> PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS and H 2-receptor antagonists (e .g.OMEPRAZOLE or RANITIDINE) may reduce concentrations for co -administered PROTEASE INHIBITORS.  For specific information regarding the impact of co -administration of acid reducing agents, refer to the Summary of Product Characteri stics of the co-administered protease inhibitor.   Based on interaction studies with the ritonavir boosted PROTEASE INHIBITORS (LOPINAVIR/ritonavir, ATAZANAVIR), concurrent administration of OMEPRAZOLE or RANITIDINE does not significantly modify ritonavir e fficacy as a pharmacokinetic enhancer despite a slight change of exposure (about 6 -18%).
