> No interaction studies have been performed . MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES do not typically have significant interaction potential, as they do not directly affect cytochrome P450 ENZYMES and are not substrates of hepatic or renal transporters. Indirect effects on cytochrome P450 ENZYMES are unlikely as the target of nirsevimab is an exogenous virus.
