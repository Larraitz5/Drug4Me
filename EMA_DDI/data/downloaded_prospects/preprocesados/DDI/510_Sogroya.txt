> Data from an interaction study performed in growth hormone deficient adults suggests that growth hormone administration may increase the clearance of compounds known to be metabolised by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. The clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome P450 (e.g. sex steroids, CORTICOSTEROIDS, anticonvulsants and CYCLOSPORINE) may be especially increased resulting in lower plasma levels of these compounds. The clinical significance of this is unknown. 
> The metabolic effects of somapacitan can also be influenced by concomitant therapy with OTHER HORMONES, e.g. TESTOSTERONE and THYROID HORMONES, see section 4.4.
