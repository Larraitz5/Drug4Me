> Concomitant use is not recommended.  Significant reductions  in exposure  and Cmin observed for  both AMPRENAVIR and RALTEGRAVIR (especially in fed conditions) may result in virological failure in  patients.  DOLUTEGRAVIR  
> No dosage adjustment of FOSAMPRENAVIR or DOLUTEGRAVIR  is recommended based on observed exposure -response relationships of clinical data. Caution is warranted and close monitoring is recommended when th is combination is  given in integrase inhibitor -resistan t patients.  CCR5 -receptor antagonists 
> Concomitant use is not recommended.  Significant reductions in AMPRENAVIR Cmin observed may result in virological failure in patients. 
>   SIMEPREVIR  DACLATASVIR  Not studied.  Results from studies with other HIV PROTEASE INHIBITORS and SIMEPREVIR  or DACLATASVIR,  suggest that co-administration with  FOSAMPRENAVIR/r itonavir is likely to lead to increased plasma exposures of SIMEPREVIR  or DACLATASVIR  due to CYP3A4 enzyme inhibition.  Not recommended.  PARITAPREVIR  (co-formulated with RITONAVIR and OMBITASVIR and co -administered with DASABUVIR)  Not studied.  Results from studies with other HIV PROTEASE INHIBITORS and PARITAPREVIR/RITONAVIR/ OMBITASVIR  +/- DASABUVIR suggest that co-administration of FOSAMPRENAVIR/r itonavir with PARITAPREVIR/RITONAVIR/ OMBITASVIR +/-DASABUVIR is likely to lead to increased plasma  exposures of PARITAPREVIR due to CYP3A4 enzyme inhibition and higher RITONAVIR dose.  Contraindicated (see section 
4.3). ANTIARRHYTHMICS 
> 
 Due to CYP3A inhibition by TELZIR, concentrations of QUETIAPINE are expected to increase.  Concomitant administration of TELZIR and QUETIAPINE is contra -indicated as it may increase QUETIAPINE- related toxicity.  Increased plasma concentrations of QUETIAPINE may lead to coma.  LURASIDONE 
> 
 No FPV/RTV drug interaction studies  LURASIDONE : ↑ expected  (CYP3A4 inhibition)  Concomitant administration of FOSAMPRENAVIR /RITONAVIR with LURASIDONE is contraindicated due to the potential for serious and/or life-threatening reactions  related to LURASIDONE  (see section 4.3)  12 INFECTION  
> The increase of 25-O-desacetylrifabutin (active metabolite) could potentially lead to an increase of RIFABUTIN related adverse events, notably uveitis. 
> The decrease in AMPRENAVIR AUC can result in virological failure and resistance development.  During attempts to overcome the decreased exposure by increasing the dose of other PROTEASE INHIBITORS with RITONAVIR, a high frequency of liver re actions was seen. 
> It is recommended that PHENYTOIN plasma concentrations be monitored and PHENYTOIN dose increased as appropriate. 
> Concomitant use is not recommended.  It may cause serious adverse reactions (see section 4.4).  HALOFANTRINE 
> 
 Concomitant use is not recommended. It may result in an increase in PDE5 inhibitor -associated adverse reactions, including hypotension, visual changes and priapism  (refer t o PDE5 inhibitor prescribing information). Patients should be warned about these possible side effects when using PDE5 inhibitors with TELZIR /RITONAVIR  (see section 
4.4). Note that co -administration of TELZIR with low dose RITONAVIR with SILDENAFIL used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension is contraindicated (see section 
4.3). INHALED/NASAL STEROIDS 
> (CYP3A4 inhibition by FPV/RTV )  Concomitant use is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 4.4). A dose reduction of the glucocorticoid with close monitoring of local and systemic effects or a switch  to a glucocorticoid, which is not a substrate for CYP3A4 (e.g. BECLOMETHASONE) should be considered. In case of withdrawal of GLUCOCORTICOIDS, progressive dose reduction may have to be performed over a longer period (see section 4.4).  15  ALPHA 1 -ADRENORECE PTOR ANTAGONIST    ALFUZOSIN, 
> Potential for increased ALFUZOSIN concentrations which can result in hypotension. The mechanism of interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition by FOSAMPRENAVIR/RITONAVIR.  Co-administration of TELZIR/RITONAVIR with ALFUZOSIN is contraindicated (see section  4.3)
> Herbal preparations containing St John’s  wort must not be combined with TELZIR (see section 4.3). If a patient is already taking St John’s wort, check AMPRENAVIR, RITONAVIR and HIV RNA and stop St John’s wort. AMPRENAVIR and RITONAVIR levels may increase on stopping St John’s wort. The inducing effect may persist for at least 2 weeks after cessation of treatment with St John’s wort.  HMG -COA REDUCTASE INHIBITORS 
> Based on data with other PROTEASE INHIBITORS plasma concentrations of MIDAZOLAM are expected to be significantly higher when MIDAZOLAM is given orally. 
> TELZIR/RITONAVIR should not be co -administered with orally administered MIDAZOLAM (see section 4.3), whereas  caution should be used with co-administration of TELZIR/RITONAVIR and parenteral MIDAZOLAM. 
> (R-) METHADONE: C max ↓  
21% The decrease of (R -) METHADONE (active 17 (R-) METHADONE: AUC ↓ 
18%
> EVEROLIMUS : ↑ expected  (CYP3A4 inhibition)  When ANTINEOPLASTIC AGENTS that are metabolised by CYP3A are co -administered with FOSAMPRENAVIR/RITONAVIR, plasma concentrations of these antineoplastic  medications may be increased and could increase the risk of adverse events usually associated with thes e ANTINEOPLASTIC AGENTS. In case of concomitant administration with ANTINEOPLASTIC AGENTS metabolized by CYP3A, please refer to the relevant product information for these medications.
