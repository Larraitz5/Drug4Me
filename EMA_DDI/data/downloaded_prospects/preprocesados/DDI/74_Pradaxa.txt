> Direct acting Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) including DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE are not recommended for patients with a history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular for patients that are triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti –beta 
2-glycoprotein I antibodies), treatment with DOACs could be associated w ith increased rates of recurrent thrombotic events compared with VITAMIN K antagonist therapy.Active cancer patients (paediatric VTE)There is limited data on efficacy and safety for paediatric patients with active cancer.Paediatric population
> DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE is a substrate for the efflux transporter P -gp. Concomitant administration of P -gp inhibitors ( see table 7) is expected to result in increased DABIGATRAN plasma concentrations.If no t otherwise specifically described, close clinical surveillance (looking for signs of bleeding or anaemia) is required when DABIGATRAN is co -administered with strong P -gpinhibitors. Dose reductions may be required in combination with some P -gp inhibitors (see sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1).Table 7: Transporter interactions
> Concomitant use contraindicated (see section 4.3)KETOCONAZOLE KETOCONAZOLE increased total DABIGATRAN AUC 0-∞and C maxvalues by 2.38-fold and 
2.35-fold, respectively, after a single oral dose of 400 mg, and by 2.53-fold and 
2.49-fold, respectively, after multiple oral dosing of 400 mg KETOCONAZOLE once daily.DRONEDARONE When DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE and DRONEDARONE were given at the same time total DABIGATRAN AUC 0-∞and C maxvalues increased by about 2.4 -fold and 2.3 -fold, respectively, after multiple dosing of 400 mg DRONEDARONE bid, and about 2.1 -fold and 1.9 -fold, respectively, after a single dose of 400 mg.ITRACONAZOLE, CYCLOSPORINE
> The concomitant use of DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE with the fixed -dose combination of the P-gp inhibitors GLECAPREVIR/PIBRENTASVIR has been shown to increase exposure of DABIGATRAN and may increase the risk of bleeding.Concomitant use not recommended
> TACROLIMUS TACROLIMUS has been found invitro to have a similar level of inhibitory effect on P-gp as that seen with ITRACONAZOLE and CYCLOSPORINE. DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE has not been clinically studied together with TACROLIMUS. However, limited clinical data with 12another P -gp substrate (EVEROLIMUS) suggest that the inhibition of P -gp with TACROLIMUS i s weaker than that observed with strong P -gp inhibitors.Cautions to be exercised in case concomitant use (see sections 4.2 and 4.4)VERAPAMIL When DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE (150 mg) was co -administered with oral VERAPAMIL, the Cmaxand AUC of DABIGATRAN were increased but the magnitude of this change differs depending on timing of administration and formulation of VERAPAMIL (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).The greatest elevation of DABIGATRAN exposure was observed with the first dose of an immediate release formulation of VERAPAMIL administered one hour prior to the DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE intake (increase of C maxby about 2.8 -fold and AUC by about 
2.5-fold). The effect was progressively decreased with administration of an extended release formulation ( increase of C maxby about 1.9 -fold and AUC by about 
1.7-fold) or administration of multiple doses of VERAPAMIL ( increase of C maxby about 1.6 -fold and AUC by about 1.5 -fold) .There was no meaningful interaction observed when VERAPAMIL was giv en 2 hours after DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE (increase of C maxby about 1.1 -fold and AUC by about 
1.2-fold). This is explained by completed DABIGATRAN absorption after 2 hours.AMIODARONE When DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE was co -administered with a single oral dose of 6 00mgamiodarone, the extent and rate of absorption of AMIODARONE and its active metabolite DEA were essentially unchanged. The DABIGATRAN AUC and C maxwere increased by about 1.6 -fold and 1.5 -fold, respectively. In view of the long half -life of AMIODARONE the potential for an interaction may exist for weeks after discontinuation of AMIODARONE (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).QUINIDINE QUINIDINE was given as 200 mg dose every 2nd hour up to a total dose of 1 000mg. DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE was given twice daily ov er 3 consecutive days, on the 3rdday either with or without QUINIDINE. DABIGATRAN AUC τ,ssand C max,sswere increased on average by 1.53 -fold and 1.56 -fold, respectively with concomitant QUINIDINE (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).CLARITHROMYCIN When clarithrom ycin (500 mg twice daily) was administered together with DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE in healthy volunteers, increase of AUC by about 1.19 -fold and Cmaxby about 1.15 -fold was observed.TICAGRELOR When a single dose of 75 mg DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE was coadministere d simultaneously with a loading dose of 180 mg TICAGRELOR, the DABIGATRAN AUC and Cmax were increased by 1.73 -fold and 1.95 -fold, respectively. After multiple doses of TICAGRELOR 90 mg b.i.d. the increase of DABIGATRAN exposure is 1.56 -fold and 
1.46-fold for C maxand AUC, respectively.Concomitant administration of a loading dose of 180 mg TICAGRELOR and 110 mg DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE (in steady state) increased the DABIGATRAN AUC τ,ssand C max,ssby 
1.49-fold and 1.65 -fold, respectively, compared with DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE given alone. When a loading dose of 180 mg TICAGRELOR was given 2 hours after 110 mg DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE (in steady state), the increase of DABIGATRAN AUC τ,ssand C max,sswas reduced to 1.27 -fold and 1.23 -fold, respectively, compared with DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE given alone. This staggered intake is the recommended administration for start of TICAGRELOR with a loading dose.Concomitant administration of 90 mg TICAGRELOR b.i.d. (maintenance dose) with 
110mg DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE increased the adjusted DABIGATRAN AUC τ,ssand C max,ss
1.26-fold and 1.29 -fold, respectively, compared with DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE given alone.POSACONAZOLE POSACONAZOLE also inhibits P -gp to some extent but has not been clinically studied. Caution should be exercise d when DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE is co-administered with POSACONAZOLE.13P-gp inducers
> Concomitant use should be avoided.e.g. rifampicin, St.John´s wort (Hypericum perforatum), CARBAMAZEPINE, or PHENYTOIN
> Concomitant administration is expected to result in decreased DABIGATRAN concentrations.Pre-dosing of the probe inducer rifampicin at a dose of 600 mg once daily for 
7days decreased total DABIGATRAN peak and total exposure by 65.5 %and 67 %, respectively. The inducing effect was diminished resulting in DABIGATRAN exposure close to the reference by day 7 after cessation of rifampicin treatment. No further increase in bioavailability was observed after another 7 days.PROTEASE INHIBITORS such as RITONAVIR
> Concomitant use not recommendede.g. RITONAVIR and its combinations with other PROTEASE INHIBITORS
> These affect P -gp (either as inhibitor or as inducer). They have not been studied and are therefore not recommended for concomitant treatment with DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE .P-gp substrate
> There is no or only limited experience with the following treatments which may increase the risk of bleeding when used concomitantly with DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE : anticoagulants such as unfractionated HEPARIN (UFH), low molecul ar weight heparins (LMWH), and HEPARIN derivatives (fondaparinux, desirudin), thrombolytic medicinal products, and VITAMIN K ANTAGONISTS, RIVAROXABAN or other oral anticoagulants (see section 4.3), and antiplatelet aggregation medicinal products such as GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists, TICLOPIDINE, PRASUGREL, TICAGRELOR, DEXTRAN, and SULFINPYRAZONE (see section 4.4).UFH can be administered at doses necessary to maintain a patent central venous or arterial catheter or during catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (see section 4.3).14Table 8: Interactions with a nticoagulants and antiplatelet aggregation medicinal products
> NSAIDs NSAIDs given for short -term analgesia have been shown not to be associated with increased bleeding risk when given in conjunction with DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE. With chronic usein a phase III clinical trial comparing DABIGATRAN to WARFARIN for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation patients (RE -LY), NSAIDs increased the risk of bleeding by approximately 50 % on both DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE and WARFARIN.CLOPIDOGREL In young healthy male volunteers, the concomitant administration of DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE and CLOPIDOGREL resulted in no further prolongation of capillary bleeding times compared to CLOPIDOGREL monotherapy. In addition, DABIGATRAN AUC τ,ssand Cmax,ssand the coagulation measures for DABIGATRAN effect or the inhibition of platelet aggregation as measure of CLOPIDOGREL effect remained essentially unchanged comparing combinedtreatment and the respective mono -treatments. With a loading dose of 300 mgor 
600mg CLOPIDOGREL, DABIGATRAN AUC τ,ssand Cmax,sswere increased by about 30 -40% (see section 4.4).ASA Co-administration of ASA and 150 mg DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE twice daily may increase the risk for any bleeding from 12 % to 18 % and 24 % with 81 mg and 325 mg ASA, respectively (see section 4.4).LMWH The concomitant use of LMWHs, such as ENOXAPARIN and DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE has not been specifically investigated. After switching from 3 -day treatment of once daily 
40mg ENOXAPARIN s.c., 24 hours after the last dose of ENOXAPARIN the exposure to DABIGATRAN was slightly lower than that after administration of DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE (single dose of 220 mg) alone. A higher anti -FXa/FIIa activity was observed after DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE administration with ENOXAPARIN pre -treatment compared to that after treatment with DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE alone. This is considered to be due to the carry -over effect of ENOXAPARIN treatment, and reg arded as not clinically relevant. Other DABIGATRAN related anti -coagulation tests were not changed significantly by the pre -treatment of ENOXAPARIN.Other interactions
> Selective serotonin re -uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or selective serotonin NOREPINEPHRINE re -uptake inhibitors (SNRIs)SSRIs, SNRIs SSRIs and SNRIs increased the risk of bleeding in all treatment groups of a phase III clinical trial comparing DABIGATRAN to WARFARIN for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation patients (RE -LY).Substances influencing gastric p
> HPantoprazole When PRADAXA was co -administered with PANTOPRAZOLE, a decrease in the DABIGATRAN AUC of approximately 30 %was observed. PANTOPRAZOLE and other proton -pump inhibitors (PPI) were co -administered with PRADAXA in clinical trials, and concomitant PPI treatment did not appear to reduce the efficacy of PRADAXA.RANITIDINE RANITIDINE administration together with DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE had no clinically relevant effect on the extent o f absorption of DABIGATRAN.Interactions linked to DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE and DABIGATRAN metabolic profile
