> Odevixibat is a substrate for the efflux transporter P- glycoprotein ( P-gp). In adult healthy subjects, co-administration of the strong P -gp inhibitor ITRACONAZOLE increased the plasma exposure of a single dose of odevixibat 7 200  mcg  by approximately 50-60%.  This increase is not considered clinically relevant.  No other potentially relevant t ransporter- mediated interactions were identified in vitro  (see section  5.2).
> In adult healthy subjects, concomitant use of odevixibat decreased the area under the curve ( AUC ) of oral MIDAZOLAM  (a CYP3A4 substrate) by 30 % and 1- OH-MIDAZOLAM exposure by less than 20%, which is  not considered clinically relevant. 
> In an interaction study with a lipophilic combination oral contraceptive containing ETHINYL ESTRADIOL (EE) (0.03 mg) and LEVONORGESTREL (LVN) (0.15 mg) conducted in adult healthy females, concomitant use o f odevixibat had no impact on the AUC of LVN and decreased the AUC of EE by 17%, which is not considered clinically relevant. Interaction studies with other lipophilic medicinal products have not been performed , therefore, an effect on the absorption of other fat-soluble medicinal products cannot be excluded.
> In clinical trials , decreased levels of fat -soluble VITAMINS were observed in some patient s receiving odevixibat. Levels of fat-soluble VITAMINS should be monitored (see section  4.4). 6  Paediatric population
