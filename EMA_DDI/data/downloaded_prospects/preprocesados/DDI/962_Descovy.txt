> In vitro  and clinical pharmacokinetic drug -drug interaction st udies have shown that the potential for CYP -mediated interactions involving EMTRICITABINE with other medicinal products is low.   Co-administration of EMTRICITABINE with medicinal products that are eliminated by active tubular secretion may increase concent rations of EMTRICITABINE, and/or the co -administered medicinal product.   Medicinal products that decrease renal function may increase concentrations of EMTRICITABINE. 
> TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE is transported by P -glycoprotein (P -gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP ).  Medicinal products that strongly affect P -gp and BCRP activity may lead to changes in TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE absorption .  Medicinal products that induce P -gp activity (e.g., rifampicin, RIFABUTIN, CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENOBARBITAL) are expected to decrease the absorption of TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE, resulting in decreased plasma concentration of TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE, which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of DESCOVY  and development of resistance.   Co-administration of DESCOVY  with other medicinal products that inhibit P -gp and BCRP activity  (e.g., COBICISTAT, RITONAVIR, CICLOSPORIN) is expected to increase the absorption and plasma concentration of TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE.  Based on data from  an in vitro study, co -administration of TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE and xanthine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., FEBUXOSTAT) is not expected to increase systemic exposure to TENOFOVIR  in vivo.
> Interact ions between the components of DESCOVY  and potential co -administered medicinal products are listed in Table  2 (increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”).  The interactions described are based on studies conducted with DESCOVY , or the components of DESCOVY  as individual agents and/or in combination, or are potential drug-drug interaction s that may occur with DESCOVY .
