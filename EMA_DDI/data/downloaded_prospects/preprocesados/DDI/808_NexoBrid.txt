> Reduction of platelet aggregation and plasma FIBRINOGEN levels and a moderate increase in partial thromboplastin and prothrombin  time s have been reported as possible effect s following oral administration of bromelain. In vitro  and animal data suggest that bromelain can also promote fibrinolysis . Caution and monitoring  is therefore needed when prescribing concomitant medicinal products that affect coagulation (see also section 4.4.).
> Topically applied antibacterial medicinal products (e.g. SILVER SULFADIAZINE or povidone IODINE) may decrease the efficacy of this medicinal product  (see section 4.4). 
> Bromelain  may enhance the actions of FLUOROURACIL and VINCRISTINE.  Patients should be monitored for increased toxicity. 
> Bromelain  may increase drowsiness caused by some medicinal products (e.g. , benzodiaz epines, barbiturates, narcotics and ANTIDEPRESSANTS) . This should be taken into account when dosing such products.
