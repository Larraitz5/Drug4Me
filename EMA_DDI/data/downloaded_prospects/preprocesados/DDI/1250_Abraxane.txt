> 4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  9  The metabolism of paclitaxel is catalysed, in part, by cyt ochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 (see se ction 5.2). Therefore , in the absence o f a PK drug -drug inte raction study , caution should be exercised when administering paclitaxel concomitantly with medicines known to inhibit ei ther CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 (e.g . ketoconaz ole and other imidazole antifungals,  ERYTHROMYCIN, FLUOXETINE,  GEMFIBROZIL, CLOPIDOGREL, cimetidin e, RITONAVIR, SAQUINAVIR, INDINAVIR,  and NELFINAVIR ) because toxicity of paclitaxel may be increased due to higher paclit axel exposure. Administeri ng paclitax el concomitantly with medicines known  to induce either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 (e.g.  rifampicin, carbamaz epine, PHENYTOIN, EFAVIRENZ, NEVIRAPINE) is not recommended because efficacy may be compromised because of lower paclitax el exposur es.
