> Metabolic interactions are not considered likely, since IBANDRONIC ACID does not inhibit the major human hepatic P450 isoenzymes and has been shown not to induce the hepatic cytochrome P450 system in rats (see section 5.2). IBANDRONIC ACID is eliminated by renal excretion only and does not undergo any biotransformation. H2-antagonists or other medicinal products that increase gastric p
> H.In healthy male volunteers and postmenopausal women, intravenous RANITIDINE caused an increase in IBANDRONIC ACID bioavailability of about 20% (which is within the normal variability of the bioavailability of IBANDRONIC ACID), probably as a result of reduced gastric acidity. However, no dosage adjustment is required when IBANDRONIC ACID is administered with H 2-antagonists or medicinal products that increase gastric p

> Caution is advised when BISPHOSPHONATES are administered with aminoglycosides, since both substances can lower serum CALCIUM levels for prolonged periods. Attention should also be paid to the possible existence of simultaneous hypomagnesaemia.
