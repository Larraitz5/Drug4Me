> No formal drug interaction s tudies have been performed. Clinically significant interactions between HERCEPTIN and the concomitant medicinal products used in clinical trials have not been observed. 
> Data from study JP16003, a single -arm study of HERCEPTIN (4 mg/kg IV loading dose and 2 mg/kg IV weekly) and DOCETAXEL (60 mg/m2 IV) in Japanese women with HER2 - positive MBC, suggested that concomitant administration of HERCEPTIN had no effect on the single dose pharmacokinetics of DOCETAXEL. Study JP19959 was a substudy of BO18255 (To
> GA) performed in male and female Japanese patients with advanced gastric cancer to study the pharmacokin etics of CAPECITABINE and CISPLATIN when used with or without HERCEPTIN. The results of this substudy suggested that the exposure to the bioactive metabolites (e.g. 5 -FU) of CAPECITABINE was not affected by concurrent use of CISPLATIN or by concurrent use of CISPLATIN plus HERCEPTIN. However, CAPECITABINE itself showed higher concentrations and a longer half -life when combined with HERCEPTIN. The data also suggested that the pharmacokinetics of CISPLATIN were not affected by concurrent use of CAPECITABINE o r by concurrent use of CAPECITABINE plus HERCEPTIN. 
> By comparison of simulated serum trastuzumab concentrations after HERCEPTIN monotherapy (4 mg/kg loading/2 mg/kg q1w IV) and observed serum concentrations in Japanese women with HER2-  positiv e MBC (study JP16003) no evidence of a PK effect of concurrent administration of DOCETAXEL on the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab was found. 
> Comparison of PK results from two Phase II studies (BO15935 and M77004) and one Phase III study (H0648g) in which patients were treated concomitantly with HERCEPTIN and PACLITAXEL and two Phase II studies in which HERCEPTIN was administered as monotherapy (W016229 and MO16982),  in women with HER2 -positive MBC indicates that individual and mean trastuzumab trough serum concentrations varied within and across studies but there was no clear effect of the concomitant administration of PACLITAXEL on the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab. Comparison of trastuzumab PK data from Study M77004 in which women with HER2- positive MB C were treated concomitantly with HERCEPTIN, PACLITAXEL and DOXORUBICIN to trastuzumab PK data in studies where HERCEPTIN was administered as monotherapy (H0649g) or in combination with anthracycline plus CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE or PACLITAXEL  (Study H0648g), sugg ested no effect of DOXORUBICIN and PACLITAXEL on the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab. 
> The administration of concomitant ANASTROZOLE did not  appear to influence the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab.
