> Sirolimus is extensively m etabolised by the CYP3A4 isozyme in the intestinal wall and liver. Sirolimus is also a substrate for the multidrug efflux pump, P -glycoprot ein (P -gp) located in the small intestine. Therefore, absorption and the subsequent elimination of sirolimus may be i nfluenced by substances that affect these proteins. Inhibitors of CYP 3A4 (such as KETOCONAZOLE, voriconaz ole, ITRACONAZOLE, TELITHROMYCIN, or CLARITHROMYCIN) decrease the metabolism of sirolimus and increase sirolimus levels. Inducers of CYP3A4 (such as ri fampin or RIFABUTIN) increase the metabolism of sirolimus and decreas e sirolimus levels. Co -administratio n of sirolimus with strong inhibit ors of CYP3A4 or inducers of CYP3A4 is not recommended (see section 4.4 ).Rifampicin (CYP3A4 inducer)Administratio n of multiple doses of rifampicin decreased sirolimus whole blood con centrations following a single 10 mgdoseof RAPAMUNE oral solution. R ifampicin increased the clearance ofsirolimus by approximately 5.5 -fold and decreased AUC and C maxby approximately 82% and 71%, respectively. Co -administration of sirolimus and rifampi cin is not recommended (see section 4.4).KETOCONAZOLE (CYP3A4 inhibi tor)Multiple -dose KETOCONAZOLE administration significantly affected the rate and extent of absorption and sirolimu s exposure from RAPAMUNE oral solution as reflected by increases in s irolimus C max, tmax, and AUC of 4.4 -fold,1.4-fold, and 10.9 -fold, res pectively. Co -administration of sirolimus and KETOCONAZOLE is not recommended (see section 4.4 ).9Voriconazole (CYP3A 4 inhibitor)Co-administration of sirolimus (2 mg single dose) with multiple -dose administration of oralvoriconazo le (400 mg e very 12 hours for 1 day, then 100 mg every 12 hours for 8 days) in healthy subjects has been reported to increase sirolimus C maxand AUC by an average of 7 -fold and 11 -fold respectively. Co -administration of sirolimus and voriconazol e is not recommended (see section 4.4).DILTIAZEM (CYP3A4 inhibitor)The simulta neous oral administration of 10 mg of RAPAMUNE oral solution and 120 mg of DILTIAZEM significantly affected the bioavailability of sirolim us. Sirolimus C max, tmax, and AUC we reincreased 
1.4-fold, 1.3 -fold, a nd 1.6 -fold, respectively. Sirolimus did not affect the pharmacokinetics of either DILTIAZEM or its metabolites desac etyldiltiazem and desmethyldiltiazem. If DILTIAZEM is administered, sirolimus blood levels should be moni toredand a dose adjustment may be necessary.VERAPAMIL (CYP3A4 inhibitor)Multiple -dose administration of VERAPAMIL and sirolimus oral solution sign ificantly affected the rate and extent of absorption of both medicina l products. Whole blood sirolimus C max, tmax, and AUC were increased 2 .3-fold, 1.1 -fold, and 2.2 -fold, respectively. Plasma S -(-) VERAPAMIL C maxand AUC were both increased 1.5 -fold, and tmaxwas decreased 24%. Sirolimus levels should be monitored, and appropriate dose reductions of both med icinal products should be consider ed.ERYTHROMYCIN (CYP3A4 inhibitor)Multiple -dose administration of ERYTHROMYCIN and sirolimus oral solution signif icantly increased the rate and extent of absorption of both medicinal products. Whole blood sirolimus C max,tmax, and AUC were increased 4. 4-fold, 1.4 -fold, and 4.2 -fold, respectively. The C max, tmax, and AUC of plasma ERYTHROMYCIN base were increased 1.6 -fold, 1.3 -fold, and 1.7 -fold, respectively. Sirolimus levels should b e monitored and appropriate dose red uctions of both medicinal products should be considered.CICLOSPORIN (CYP3A4 substrate)The rate and extent of sirolimus absorption was significantly increased by CICLOSPORIN A (Cs
> A administration, sirolimu s Cmaxand AUC were not affected. Single -dose sirolimus did not affect the pharmacokinetics of CICLOSPORIN (microemulsion) in healthy volunteers when a dministered simultaneously or 4 hours apart. It is recommended that R apamune be administered 4 hours afte r CICLOSPORIN (microemulsion).CANNABIDIOL (P-gpinhibitor )There have been reports ofincreased blood levels ofsirolimus during concomitant usewith CANNABIDIOL. Co-administration ofcannabidiol with another orally administered m
> Inhibi tors of CYP3A4 may decrease the metabolism of sirolimus and increase sirolimus blood lev els. Such inhibitors include certa inantifungal s(e.g. CLOTRIMAZOLE, FLUCONAZOLE , ITRACONAZOLE, VORICONAZOLE ),certain ANTIBIOTICS (e.g. trolea ndomycin, TELITHROMYCIN, CLARITHROMYCIN ),certain PROTEASE INHIBITORS (e.g. RITONAVIR, INDINAVIR, BOCEPREVIR, tel aprevir), NICARDIPINE, bromo cripti ne, CIMETIDINE, DANAZOL and LETERMOVIR .Inducers of CYP3A4 may increase the metabolism of sirolimus and dec reasesirolimus bloo dlevels (e.g. S t. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum ),anticonvulsants: CARBAMAZEPINE, phenob arbital, PHENYTOIN).Although sir olimu s inhibits human liver microsomal cytochrome P 450 CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5 in vitro , the ac tive substance is no texpected to in hibit the activity of these isozymes invivo since the sirolimus concentratio ns necessary to produce inhibition are much higher than those observed in patients receiving therapeutic doses of RAPAMUNE.
