> Ritonavir has a high affinity for several cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms and may inhibit oxidation with the following ranked order: CYP3A4 > CYP2D6. Co- administration of ritonavir and medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP3A may result in increase d plasma concentrations of the other medicinal product, which could increase or prolong its therapeutic and adverse effects. For selected medicinal products (e.g. ALPRAZOLAM) the inhibitory effects of ritonavir on CYP3A4 may decrease over time. Ritonavir a lso has a high affinity for P -glycoprotein and may inhibit this transporter. The inhibitory effect of ritonavir (with or without other PROTEASE INHIBITORS) on P- gp activity may decrease over time (e.g. DIGOXIN and FEXOFENADINE -see table “Ritonavir effects on non- antiretroviral medicinal products” below). Ritonavir may induce glucuronidation and oxidation by CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 thereby increasing the biotransformation of some medicinal products metabolised by these pathways, and may result in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could decease or shorten their therapeutic effect.
> Serum levels of ritonavir can be reduced by concomitant use of herbal preparations containing St John’s wort ( Hypericum perforatum). This is due to the induction of medicinal product metabolising ENZYMES by St John’s wort. Herbal preparations containing St John’s wort must not be used in combination with ritonavir. If a patient is already taking St John’s wort, St John’s wort should be stopped and if possible check viral levels. Ritonavir levels may increase on stopping St John’s wort. The dose of ritonavir may need adjusting. The inducing effect may persist for at least 2  weeks after cessation of treatment with St John’s wort (see section 4.3).

> AMPHETAMINE derivatives      AMPHETAMINE  Ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent is likely to inhibit CYP2D6 and as a result is expected to increase concentrations of AMPHETAMINE and its derivatives. Careful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is recommended when these medicinal products are concomitantly administered with antiretroviral doses of ritonavir (see section 4.4). 
> The increases of plasma levels of BUPRENORPHINE and its active metabolite did not lead to clinically significant pharmacodynamic changes in a population of opioid tolerant patients. Adjustment to the dose of BUPRENORPHINE or ritonavir may therefore not be necessary when the two a re dosed together. When ritonavir is used in combination with another protease inhibitor and BUPRENORPHINE, the SPC of the co-administered protease inhibitor should be reviewed for specific dosing information. 
> Pethidine, PROPOXYPHENE  Ritonavir co -administration is likely to result in increased plasma concentrations of norpethidine and PROPOXYPHENE and is therefore contraindicated (see section 4.3).  FENTANYL  Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent inhibits CYP3A4 and as a result is expected to increase the plasma concentrations of FENTANYL. Careful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects (including respiratory depression) is recommended when FENTANYL is concomitantly administered with ritonavir. 
> Increased METHADONE dose may be necessary when concomitantly administered with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer due to induction of glucuronidation. Dose adjustment should be considered based on the patient’s clinical response to METHADONE therapy.

> ENCORAFENIB  Serum concentrations may be increased when co -administered with ritonavir which may increase the risk of toxicity, including the risk of serious adverse events such as QT interval prolongation.  Co-administration of ENCORAFENIB and ritonavir should be avoi ded.  If the benefit is considered to outweigh the risk and ritonavir must be used, patients should be carefully monitored for safety. 
> IBRUTINIB  Serum concentrations of IBRUTINIB may be increased due to CYP3A inhibition by ritonavir, resulting in increased risk for toxicity including risk of tumor lysis syndrome. Co- administration of IBRUTINIB and ritonavir should be avoided. If the benefit is cons idered to outweigh the risk and ritonavir must be used, reduce the IBRUTINIB dose to 140 mg and monitor patient closely for toxicity.

> Inhibition of CYP3A and P -gp lead  to increased plasma levels and pharmacodynamic effects of RIVAROXABAN which may lead to an increased bleeding risk. Therefore, the use of ritonavir is not recommended in patients receiving RIVAROXABAN. 
> VORAPAXAR  Serum concentrations may be increased due to CYP3A inhibition by ritonavir. The co -administration of VORAPAXAR with ritonavir is not recommended (see section 4.4 and refer to the VORAPAXAR Sm
> Induction of CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 lead to decreased levels of R-WARFARIN while little pharmacokinetic effect is noted on S -WARFARIN when co -administered with ritonavir. Decreased R -WARFARIN levels may lead to reduced anticoagulation, therefore it is recommend ed that anticoagulation parameters are monitored when WARFARIN is co-administered with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer. 
> Anticonvulsants      CARBAMAZEPINE  Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent inhibits CYP3A4 and as a result is expected to increase the plasma concentrations of CARBAMAZEPINE. Careful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is recommended when CARBAMAZEPINE is concomitantly administered with ritonavir .
> Divalproex, LAMOTRIGINE, PHENYTOIN  Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent induces oxidation by CYP2C9 and glucuronidation and as a result is expected to decrease the plasma concentrations of anticonvulsants.  Careful monitoring of serum levels or therapeutic effects is recommended when these medicinal products are concomitantly administered with ritonavir. PHENYTOIN may decrease serum levels of ritonavir. 
> ANTIDEPRESSANTS      AMITRIPTYLINE, FLUOXETINE, IMIPRAMINE, NORTRIPTYLINE, PAROXETINE, SERTRALINE  Ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent is likely to inhibit CYP2D6 and as a result is expected to increase concentrations of IMIPRAMINE, AMITRIPTYLINE, NORTRIPTYLINE, FLUOXETINE, PAROXETINE or SERTRALINE. Careful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse e ffects is recommended when these medicinal products are concomitantly administered with antiretroviral doses of ritonavir (see section 4.4). 
> The AUC and C max of the 2 -hydroxy metabolite were decreased 15  and 
67%, respectively. Dose reduction of DESIPRAMINE is recommended when co -administered with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent. 
> An increase in the incidence in TRAZODONE -related adverse reactions was noted when co- administered with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer. If TRAZODONE is co -administered with ritonavir, the combination should be used with caution, initiating TRAZODONE at the lowest dose and monitoring for clinical response and tolerability. 
> Anti -gout treatments      COLCHICINE  Concentrations of COLCHICINE are expected to increase when co-administered with ritonavir.  Life-threatening and fatal drug interactions have been reported in patients treated with COLCHICINE and ritonavir (CYP3A4 and P -gp inhibition) in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). Refer to the COLCHICINE prescribing information. 
> Antihistamines      ASTEMIZOLE, TERFENADINE  Ritonavir co -administration is likely to result in increased plasma concentrations of ASTEMIZOLE and TERFENADINE and is therefore contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
> FEXOFENADINE  Ritonavir may modify P -glycoprotein mediated FEXOFENADINE efflux when dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer resulting in increased concentrations of FEXOFENADINE. Increased FEXOFENADINE levels may lessen over time as induction develops. 
> LORATADINE  Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent inhibits CYP3A and as a result is expected to increase the plasma concentrations of LORATADINE. Careful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is recommended when LORATADINE is concomitantly administered with ritonavir. 
> Anti -infectives      FUSIDIC ACID  Ritonavir co -administration is likely to result in increased plasma concentrations of both FUSIDIC ACID and ritonavir and is therefore contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
> Due to the large increase in RIFABUTIN AUC, the concomitant use of RIFABUTIN with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent is contraindicated (see section 4.3). The reduction of the RIFABUTIN dose to 150 mg 3  times per week may be indicated for select PIs when co-administered with ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer. The Summary of Product Characteristics of the co -administered protease inhibitor should be consulted for specific recommendations.  Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate treatment of tuberculosis in HIV -infected patients. 
> Concomitant use of ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent and VORICONAZOLE is contraindicated due to reduction in VORICONAZOLE concentrations (see section 4.3). Co -administration of VORICONAZOLE and ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer should be avoided, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of VORICONAZOLE. 
> ATOVAQUONE  Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent induces glucuronidation and as a result is expected to decrease the plasma concentrations of ATOVAQUONE. Careful monitoring of serum levels or therapeutic effects is recommended when ATOVAQUONE is conc omitantly administered with ritonavir. 
> BEDAQUILINE  No interaction study is available with ritonavir only. In an interaction study of single -dose BEDAQUILINE and multiple dose LOPINAVIR/ritonavir, the AUC of BEDAQUILINE was increased by 22%. This increase is likely due to ritonavir and a more pronounced eff ect may be observed during prolonged co- administration. Due to the risk of BEDAQUILINE related adverse events, co -administration should be avoided. If the benefit outweighs the risk, co- administration of BEDAQUILINE with ritonavir must be done with caution . More frequent electrocardiogram monitoring and monitoring of transaminases is recommended (see section 4.4 and refer to the BEDAQUILINE Summary of Product Characteristics). 
> ERYTHROMYCIN, ITRACONAZOLE  Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent inhibits CYP3A4 and as a result is expected to increase the plasma concentrations of ERYTHROMYCIN and ITRACONAZOLE. Careful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is recomme nded when ERYTHROMYCIN or ITRACONAZOLE is used concomitantly administered with ritonavir. 
> Ritonavir inhibits CYP3A -mediated metabolism of KETOCONAZOLE. Due to an increased incidence of gastrointestinal and hepatic adverse reactions, a dose reduction of KETOCONAZOLE should be considered when co-administered with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer. 
> Dose alteration of SULFAMETHOXAZOLE/TRIMETHOPRIM during concomitant ritonavir therapy should not be necessary. 
> ANTIPSYCHOTICS/Neuroleptics      CLOZAPINE, PIMOZIDE  Ritonavir co -administration is likely to result in increased plasma concentrations of CLOZAPINE or PIMOZIDE and is therefore contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
> HALOPERIDOL, RISPERIDONE, THIORIDAZINE  Ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent is likely to inhibit CYP2D6 and as a result is expected to increase concentrations of HALOPERIDOL, RISPERIDONE and THIORIDAZINE. Careful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is recommended when these medicinal products are concomitantly administered with antiretroviral doses of ritonavir. 
> LURASIDONE  Due to CYP3A inhibition by ritonavir, concentrations of LURASIDONE are expected to increase. The concomitant administration with LURASIDONE is contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
> QUETIAPINE  Due to CYP3A inhibition by ritonavir, concentrations of QUETIAPINE are expected to increase. Concomitant administration of ritonavir and QUETIAPINE is contraindicated as it may increase QUETIAPINE -related toxicity (see section 4.3). 
> 
β2-agonist (long acting)      SALMETEROL  Ritonavir inhibits CYP3A4 and as a result a pronounced increase in the plasma concentrations of SALMETEROL is expected. Therefore concomitant use is not recommended. 
> CALCIUM channel antagonists      AMLODIPINE, DILTIAZEM, NIFEDIPINE  Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent inhibits CYP3A4 and as a result is expected to increase the plasma concentrations of CALCIUM channel antagonists. Careful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is recommend ed when these medicinal products are concomitantly administered with ritonavir. 
> Endothelin antagonists      BOSENTAN  Co-administration of BOSENTAN and ritonavir may increase steady state BOSENTAN maximum concentrations (C max) and area under the curve (AUC).

> HCV Direct Acting Antiviral   GLECAPREVIR/PIBRENTASVIR  Serum concentrations may be increased due to P -glycoprotein, BCRP and OATP1B inhibition by ritonavir. 
> Concomitant administration of GLECAPREVIR/PIBRENTASVIR and ritonavir  is not recommended due to an increased risk of ALT elevations associated with increased GLECAPREVIR exposure. 
> Ritonavir increases plasma concentrations of SIMEPREVIR as a result of CYP3A4 inhibition. It is not recommended to co- administer ritonavir with SIMEPREVIR. 
> A reductase inhibitors which are highly dependent on CYP3A metabolism, such as LOVASTATIN and SIMVASTATIN, are expected to have markedly increased plasma concentrations when co -administered with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer. Since increased concentrations of LOVASTATIN and SIMVASTATIN may predispose patients to myopathies, including rhabdomyolysis, the combination of these medicinal products with ritonavir is contraindicated (see section 4.3). ATORVASTATIN is less dependent on CYP3A for metabolism. While ROSUVASTATIN elimination is not dependent on CYP3A, an elevation of ROSUVASTATIN exposure ha s been reported with ritonavir co- administration. The mechanism of this interaction is not clear, but may be the result of transporter inhibition.  When used with ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent, the lowest possible doses of ATORVASTATIN or ROSUVASTATIN should be administered. The metabolism of PRAVASTATIN and FLUVASTATIN is not dependent on CYP3A, and inter actions are not expected with ritonavir. If treatment with an HMG -Co
> IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS      CYCLOSPORINE, TACROLIMUS, EVEROLIMUS  Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent inhibits CYP3A4 and as a result is expected to increase the plasma concentrations of CYCLOSPORINE, TACROLIMUS or EVEROLIMUS.  Careful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is recommended when these medicinal products are concomitantly administered with ritonavir.

Due to CYP3A inhibition by ritonavir, concentrations of LOMITAPIDE are expected to increase.  Concomitant use of ritonavir with LOMITAPIDE is contraindicated (see prescribing information for LOMITAPIDE) (see section 4.3). 
> Concomitant use of AVANAFIL with ritonavir is contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
> Concomitant use of SILDENAFIL for the treatment of erectile dysfunction with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer should be with caution and in no instance should SILDENAFIL doses exceed 25  mg in 48 hours (see also se ction 4.4). Concomitant use of SILDENAFIL with ritonavir is contraindicated in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients (see section 4.3). 
> The concomitant use of TADALAFIL for the treatment of erectile dysfunction with ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer should be with caution at reduced doses of no more than 10 mg TADALAFIL every 72  hours with increased monitoring for adverse reactions (see section 4.4). 
> Concomitant use of VARDENAFIL with ritonavir is contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
> 24 Co-administered medicinal products  Dose of co-administered medicinal products (mg)  Dose of ritonavir (mg)  Effect on co-administered medicinal products AUC  Effect on co-administered medicinal products Cmax Sedatives/hypnotics      CLORAZEPATE, DIAZEPAM, ESTAZOLAM, FLURAZEPAM, oral and parenteral MIDAZOLAM  Ritonavir co -administration is likely to result in increased plasma concentrations of CLORAZEPATE, DIAZEPAM, ESTAZOLAM and FLURAZEPAM and is therefore contraindicated (see section 4.3).  MIDAZOLAM is extensively metabolised by CYP3A4. Co- administration with ritonavir may cause a large increase in the concentration of this benzodiazepine. No medicinal product interaction study has been performed for the co- administration of ritonavir with b enzodiazepines.  Based on data for other CYP3A4 inhibitors, plasma concentrations of MIDAZOLAM are expected to be significantly higher when MIDAZOLAM is given orally. Therefore, ritonavir should not be co- administered with orally administered MIDAZOLAM (see section 4.3), w hereas caution should be used with co- administration of ritonavir and parenteral MIDAZOLAM. Data from concomitant use of parenteral MIDAZOLAM with other PROTEASE INHIBITORS suggest a possible 3 –  4 fold increase in MIDAZOLAM plasma levels. If ritonavir is co -administered with parenteral MIDAZOLAM, it should be done in an intensive care unit (ICU) or similar setting which ensures close clinical monitoring and appropriate medical management in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation. Dose adj ustment for MIDAZOLAM should be considered, especially if more than a single dose of MIDAZOLAM is administered. 
> Ritonavir co -administration is likely to result in increased plasma concentrations of TRIAZOLAM and is therefore contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
> BUSPIRONE  Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent inhibits CYP3A and as a result is expected to increase the plasma concentrations of BUSPIRONE. Careful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is recommended when BUSPIRONE concomitantly administered with ritonavir. 
> BUPROPION is primarily metabolised by CYP2B6. Concurrent administration of BUPROPION with repeated doses of ritonavir is expected to decrease BUPROPION levels. These effects are thought to represent induction of BUPROPION metabolism. However, because riton avir has also been shown to inhibit CYP2B6 in vitro , the recommended dose of BUPROPION should not be exceeded. In contrast to long- term administration of ritonavir, there was no significant interaction with BUPROPION after short -term administration of low doses of ritonavir (200 mg twice daily for 2 days), suggesting reductions in BUPROPION concentrations may have onset several days after initiation of ritonavir co -administration. 
> Steroids      Inhaled, injectable or intranasal FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE, BUDESONIDE, TRIAMCINOLONE  Systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression (plasma cortisol levels were noted to be decreased 86% in the above study) have been reported in patients receiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasal FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE; similar effects could also occur with other CORTICOSTEROIDS metabolised by CYP3A e.g., BUDESONIDE and TRIAMCINOLONE. Consequently, concomitant administration of ritonavir dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer and these GLUCOCORTICOIDS is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 4.4). A dose reduction of the glucocorticoid should be considered with close monitoring of local and systemic effect s or a switch to a glucocorticoid, which is not a substrate for CYP3A4 (e.g., BECLOMETHASONE). Moreover, in case of withdrawal of GLUCOCORTICOIDS progressive dose reduction may be required over a longer period. 
> DEXAMETHASONE  Ritonavir dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent inhibits CYP3A and as a result is expected to increase the plasma concentrations of DEXAMETHASONE. Careful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is recommended when DEXAMETHASONE is concomitantly administered with ritonavir. 
> Careful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is recommended when PREDNISOLONE is concomitantly administered with ritonavir. The AUC of the metabolite PREDNISOLONE increased by 37 and 28% after 4 and 14  days ritonavir, respectively. 
> Cardiac and neurologic events have been reported when ritonavir has been co- administered with DISOPYRAMIDE, MEXILETINE or NEFAZODONE. The possibility of medicinal product interaction cannot be excluded.  26  In addition to the interactions listed above, as ritonavir is highly protein bound, the possibility of increased therapeutic and toxic effects due to protein binding displacement of concomitant medicinal products should be considered.

2-receptor antagonists PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS and H 2-receptor antagonists (e.g. OMEPRAZOLE or RANITIDINE) may reduce concentrations for co -administered PROTEASE INHIBITORS. For specific information regarding the impact of co- administration of acid reducing agents, refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of the co-administered protease inhibitor. Based on interaction studies with the ritonavir boosted PROTEASE INHIBITORS (LOPINAVIR/ritonavir, ATAZANAVIR), concurrent administration of OMEPRAZOLE or RANITIDINE does not significantly modify ritonavir efficacy as a pharmacokinetic enhancer despite a slight change of exposure (about 6 - 18%).
