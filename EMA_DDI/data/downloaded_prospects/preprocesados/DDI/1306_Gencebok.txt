> Although few data exist on interactions of CAFFEINE with other active substances in preterm newborn infants, lower doses of CAFFEINE CITRATE may be needed following co -administration of active substances which are reported to decrease CAFFEINE elimination in adults (e.g., CIMETIDINE and KETOCONAZOLE) and higher CAFFEINE CITRATE doses may be needed following co -administration of active substances that increase CAFFEINE elimination (e.g., PHENOBARBITAL and PHENYTOIN). Where doubt exists about possible interactions, plasma CAFFEINE concentrations should be measured.  As bacterial overgrowth in the gut is associated with the development of necrotising enterocolitis, co - administration of CAFFEINE CITRATE with medicinal products that suppress gastric acid secretion (antihistamine H2 receptor blockers or proton-pump inhibitors) may in theory increase the risk of necrotising enterocolitis (see section 4.4 and 4.8).  6 Concurrent use of CAFFEINE and DOXAPRAM might potentiate their stimulatory effects on the cardio- respiratory and CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. If concurrent use is indicated, cardiac rhythm and blood pressure must be carefully monitored.
