> Co-administration of BRENTUXIMAB VEDOTIN with KETOCONAZOLE, a strong CYP3A4 and P -gp inhibitor, increased the exposure to the antimicrotubule agent MMAE by approximately 73%, and did not alter the plasma exposure to BRENTUXIMAB VEDOTIN. Therefore, co- administration of BRENTUXIMAB VEDOTIN with strong CYP3A4 and P -gp inhibitors may increase the incidence of neutropenia. If neutropenia develops, refer to Tables  1 and 2 for dosing recommendations for neutropenia (see section  4.2). 
> Co-administration of BRENTUXIMAB VEDOTIN with rifampicin, a strong C YP3A4 inducer, did not alter the plasma exposure to BRENTUXIMAB VEDOTIN. Though PK data are limited, co- administration of rifampicin appeared to reduce plasma concentrations of MMAE metabolites that could be assayed.   Co-administration of MIDAZOLAM, a CYP 3A4 substrate, with BRENTUXIMAB VEDOTIN did not alter the metabolism of MIDAZOLAM; therefore BRENTUXIMAB VEDOTIN is not expected to alter the exposure to medicines that are metabolised by CYP3A4 ENZYMES. 
> The serum and plasma pharmacokinetic characteristics of antibody drug conjugate ( ADC) and MMAE respectively following administration of BRENTUXIMAB VEDOTIN in combination with AVD were similar to that in mon otherapy.
> 11 Co-administration of BRENTUXIMAB VEDOTIN did not affect the plasma exposure of AVD.
> The serum and plasma pharmacokinetic characteristics of ADC and MMAE, respectively, following administration  of BRENTUXIMAB VEDOTIN in combination with CHP were similar to that in monotherapy. 
> Co-administration of BRENTUXIMAB VEDOTIN is not expected to affect the exposure of CHP.
> There were no formal drug- drug interaction studies with brentuximab ve dotin and BLEOMYCIN (B). In a phase 1  dose finding and safety study (SGN35- 009), unacceptable pulmonary toxicity (including 
2 fatal events) was noted in 11 of 25 patients (44%) treated with BRENTUXIMAB VEDOTIN plus ABVD. No pulmonary toxicity or fatal events were reported with BRENTUXIMAB VEDOTIN + AVD. Therefore, co-administration of ADCETRIS with BLEOMYCIN is contraindicated (see section 4.3).
