> Since bradycardia constitutes a risk factor in the occurrence of torsades de pointes, the combination of rivastigmine  with QT prolongation - or torsades de pointes -inducing medicinal products such as ANTIPSYCHOTICS i.e. some phenothiazines (CHLORPROMAZINE, LEVOMEPROMAZINE) , BENZAMIDES (SULPIRIDE, sultopride, AMISULPRIDE, tiapride, veralipride), PIMOZIDE, HALOPERIDOL, DROPERIDOL, CISAPRIDE, citalopr am, diphemanil, ERYTHROMYCIN IV, halofantrin, mizolastin, METHADONE, PENTAMIDINE  and moxifloxacine  should be observed with caution and c linical monitoring  (ECG) may also be required. 
> No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between rivastigmine and dig oxin, WARFARIN, DIAZEPAM or FLUOXETINE in studies in healthy volunteers.  The increase in prothrombin time induced by WARFARIN is not affected by administration of rivastigmine. No untoward effects on cardiac conduction were observed following concomitant a dministration of DIGOXIN and rivastigmine.
