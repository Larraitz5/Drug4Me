> Co-administration of multiple doses of SITAGLIPTIN  (50 mg tw ice daily) and METFORMIN (1,000  mg twice  daily) did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of either SITAGLIPTIN or METFORMIN in patients  with type  2 diabetes. 
> Some medicinal products can adversely affect renal function, which may increase the risk of lactic  acidosis, e.g. NSAIDs, including selective cyclo -oxygenase (COX) II inhibitors, ACE inhibitors,  angiotensin II receptor antagonists and DIURETICS, especially LOOP DIURETICS. When starting or using  such products in combination with METFORMIN, close monitoring of renal function is necessary. 
> Concomitant use of medicinal products that interfere with common renal tubular transport systems involved in the  renal elimination of METFORMIN (e.g., organic cationic transporter -2 [OCT2] / multidrug and toxin  extrusion [MATE] inhibitors such as RANOLAZINE, VANDETANIB, DOLUTEGRAVIR, and CIMETIDINE) could  increase systemic exposure to METFORMIN and may increase the risk for lactic acidosis. Consider the benefits and risks of concomitant use. Close monitoring of glycaemic control, dose adjustment within  the recommended posology and changes in diabetic treatment should be considered when such  products are co -administered. 
> ACE -inhibitors may decrease the blood GLUCOSE levels. If necessary, the dose of the  anti-hyperglycaemic medicinal product should be adjusted during therapy with the other medicinal  product and on its discontinuation. 
> In vitro transport studies showed that SITAGLIPTIN is a substrate for p -glycoprotein and organic anion  transporter -3 (OAT3). OAT3 mediated transport of SITAGLIPTIN was inhibited in vitro by PROBENECID,  8 although the risk of clinically meaningful interactions is considered to be low. Concomitant  administration of OAT3 inhibitors has not been evaluated in vivo .
> CICLOSPORIN: A study was conducted to assess the effect of CICLOSPORIN, a potent inhibitor of  p-glycoprotein, on the pharmacokinetics of SITAGLIPTIN. Co -administration of a single 100  mg oral dose  of SITAGLIPTIN and a single 600  mg oral dose of CICLOSPORIN increased the AUC and C max of SITAGLIPTIN by approximately 29% and 68%, respectively. These changes in sitagl iptin pharmacokinetics were not considered to be clinically meaningful. The renal clearance of sitaglipti n was not meaningfully altered. Therefore, meaningful interactions would not be expected with other p -glycoprotein inhibitors. 
> DIGOXIN: SITAGLIPTIN had a small effect on plasma DIGOXIN concentrations. Following administration of  
0.25 mg DIGOXIN concomitantly with 100  mg of SITAGLIPTIN daily for 10  days, the plasma AUC of  DIGOXIN was increased on average by 11%, and the plasma C max on average by 18%. No dose  adjustment of DIGOXIN is recommended. However, patients at risk of DIGOXIN toxicity should be  monitored for this when SITAGLIPTIN and DIGOXIN are administered concomitantly.
