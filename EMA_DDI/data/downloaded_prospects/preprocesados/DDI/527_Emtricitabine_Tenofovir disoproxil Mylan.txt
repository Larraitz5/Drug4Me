> As EMTRICITABINE/TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL fixed-dose combination tablets contains EMTRICITABINE and TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL, any interactions that have been identified with these agents individually may occur with the fixed-dose combination. Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
> DIDANOSINE: The co-administration of EMTRICITABINE/TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL and DIDANOSINE is not recommended (see section 4.4 and Table 2). 
> Renally eliminated medicinal products: Since EMTRICITABINE and TENOFOVIR are primarily eliminated by the kidneys, co-administration of EMTRICITABINE/TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL with medicinal products that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion (e.g. CIDOFOVIR) may increase serum concentrations of EMTRICITABINE, TENOFOVIR and/or the co-administered medicinal products.
> Use of EMTRICITABINE/TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic medicinal product. Some examples include, but are not limited to, aminoglycosides, AMPHOTERICIN B, FOSCARNET, GANCICLOVIR, PENTAMIDINE, VANCOMYCIN, CIDOFOVIR or interleukin-2 (see section 4.4).
