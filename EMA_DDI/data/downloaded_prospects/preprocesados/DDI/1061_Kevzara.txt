> VARIOUS in v itro and limited in vivo  human studies have shown that cytokines and cytokine modulators can influence the expression and activity of specific cytochrome P450 (CYP) ENZYMES (CY P1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4) and therefore have the potential to alter th e pharm acokinetics of concomitantly administered medicinal products that are substrates of these ENZYMES. E levated levels of interleukin -6 (IL -6) may down-regulate CYP activity s uch as in patients with RA and hence increase drug levels compared to subjects  withou t RA. Blockade of IL-6 signalling by IL- 6RÎ± antagonists such as sarilumab might reverse the inhibito ry effect of IL -6 and restore CYP activity, leading to altered medicin al products concentrations.
