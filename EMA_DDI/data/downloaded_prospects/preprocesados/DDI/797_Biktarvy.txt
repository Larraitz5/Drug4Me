> BICTEGRAVIR  is a substrate of CYP3A and UGT1A1.   Co-admin istration of BICTEGRAVIR and medicinal products that potent ly induce both CYP3A and UGT1A1, such as rifamp icin or St.  John’s wort , may significantly decrease plasma concentrations of BICTEGRAVIR , which may result in a loss of  therapeutic effect of BIKTARVY  and development of resistance , therefore  co-administration is contraindicated  (see section  4.3).  Co-administration of BICTEGRAVIR with medicinal products that potently inhibit both CYP3A and UGT1A1, such as ATAZANAVIR, may significantly increase plasma concentrations of BICTEGRAVIR, therefore co-administration is not recommended. 
> BICTEGRAVIR  inhibits organic cation transporter  2 (OCT2) and multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter  1 (MATE1) in vitro .  Co-administration of BIKTARVY  with the OCT2 and MATE1 substrate METFORMIN did not result in a clinically significant increase in METFORMIN exposure.   BIKTARVY  may be co-administered with substrates of OCT2 and MATE1. 
> In vitro  and clinical pharmacokinetic drug -drug interaction studies have shown that the potential for CYP -mediated interactions involving EMTRICITABINE  with other medicinal products is low.   Co-administration of EMTRICITABINE  with medicinal products  that are eliminated by active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of EMTRICITABINE , and/or the co -administered medicinal product .  Medicinal products  that decrease renal function may increase concentrations of EMTRICITABINE .
> TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE is transported by P -glycoprotein (P -gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP ).  Co-administration of BIKTARVY  with m edicinal products that strongly affect P -gp and BCRP  
7 activity may lead to changes in teno fovir alafenamide absorption.   Medicinal products that induce P-gp activity (e.g. RIFABUTIN, carbam azepine, PHENOBARBITAL)  are expected to decrease the absorption of TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE, resulting in decreased plasma concentration of TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE, which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of BIKTARVY  and development of resistance.   Co-administration of BIKTARVY  with other medicinal products that inhibit P -gp and BCRP  may increase the absorption and plasma concentration of TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE. 
> Interactions  between BIKTARVY  or its individual component(s) and co -administered medicinal products are listed in Table  1 below (increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓” and no change as “↔” ; all No Effect Boundaries are 70% -143% ).
