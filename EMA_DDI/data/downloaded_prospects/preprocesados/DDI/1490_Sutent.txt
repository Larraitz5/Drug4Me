> 9 Medicinal products that may increase sunitinib plasma concentrations  Effect of CYP3A4 inhibitors  In healthy volunteers,  concomitant administration of a single dose of sunitinib with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor KETOCONAZOLE resulted in an increase of the combined [sunitinib + primary metabolite] maximum concentration ( Cmax) and area under the curve ( AUC 0-) values of 49% and 
51%, respec tively. 
> Administration of sunitinib with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors ( e.g., RITONAVIR , ITRACONAZOLE, ERYTHROMYCIN, CLARITHROMYCIN, GRAPEFRUIT JUICE) may increase sunitinib concentrations .
> Administration of sunitinib  with potent CYP3A4 inducers ( e.g., DEXAMETHASONE, PHENYTOIN, CARBAMAZEPINE, rifampicin, PHENOBARBITAL or herbal preparations containing St. John’s Wort /Hypericum perforatum ) may decrease sunitinib concentrations.  Combination with CYP3A4  inducers should therefore be avoided, or selection of an alternate concomitant medicinal product,  with no or minimal potential to induce CYP3A4 should be considered . If this is not possible, the dose of S utent  may need to be increased in 12.5  mg increments (up to 87.5  mg per day for GIST and MRCC or 62.5  mg per day for p
