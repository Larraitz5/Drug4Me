> In vitro  and clinical pharmacokinetic drug -drug interaction studies have shown that the potential for CYP -mediated interactions involving EMTRICITABINE  with other medicinal products is low.   Co-administration of EMTRICITABINE  with medicinal products  that are eliminated by active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of EMTRICITABINE , and/or the co -administered medicinal product .  Medicinal products  that decrease renal function may increase concentrations of EMTRICITABINE .

> TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE is transported by P -gp and breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ).  Medicinal products that affect P -gp and BCRP activity may lead to changes in TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE absorption (see Table  1).  Medicinal products that induce P -gp activity (e.g., rifampicin, RIFABUTIN, carbam azepine, PHENOBARBITAL)  are expected to decrease the absorption of TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE, resulting in decreased plasma concentration of  TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE, which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of ODEFSEY  and development of resistance.  Co -administration of ODEFSEY  with other medicinal products that inhibit P -gp and BCRP activity  (e.g., KETOCONAZOLE, FLUCONAZOLE, ITRACONAZOLE, p osaconazole, VORICONAZOLE , CICLOSPORIN) is expected to increase the absorption and plasma concentration of TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE.   Based on data from an in vitro  study, co -administration of TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE and xanthine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., FEBUXOSTAT) is not expected to increase systemic exposure to TENOFOVIR in vivo. 
> Co-administration of ODEFSEY  and medicinal products that induce CYP3A has been observed to decrease the plasma concentrations of RILPIVIRINE which could potentially lead to loss of virologic response  to ODEFSEY  (see section  4.3) and possible resistance to RILPIVIRINE and to the NNRTI  class .
