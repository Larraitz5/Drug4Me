> Vedolizumab has been studied in adult ulcerative colitis and Crohnâ€™s disease patients with concomitant administration of CORTICOSTEROIDS, immunomodulators (AZATHIOPRINE, 6 -MERCAPTOPURINE, and METHOTREXATE), and aminosalicylates. Population pharmacokinetic analyses suggest that co-administration of such agents did not have a clinically meaningful effect on vedolizumab pharmacokinetics.   In adult patients with pouchitis, vedolizumab has been co-administered  with ANTIBIOTICS  (see section  5.1). The pharmacokinetics of vedolizumab in patients with pouchitis has not been studied (see section  5.2).
