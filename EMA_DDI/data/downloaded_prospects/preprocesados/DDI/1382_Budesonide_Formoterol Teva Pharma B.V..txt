> Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. KETOCONAZOLE, ITRACONAZOLE, VORICONAZOLE, POSACONAZOLE, CLARITHROMYCIN, TELITHROMYCIN, NEFAZODONE and HIV PROTEASE INHIBITORS) are likely to markedly increase plasma levels of BUDESONIDE and concomitant use should be a voided. If this is not possible the time interval between administration of the inhibitor and BUDESONIDE should be as long as possible ( see section 4.4). 
> The potent CYP3A4 inhibitor KETOCONAZOLE, 200 mg once daily, increased plasma levels of concomitantl y orally administered BUDESONIDE (single dose 3 mg) on average six -fold. When KETOCONAZOLE was administered 12 hours after BUDESONIDE the concentration was on average increased only three-fold showing that separation of the administration times can reduce the increase in plasma levels. Limited data about this Medicinal product no longer authorised8 interaction for high- dose inhaled BUDESONIDE indicates that marked increases in plasma levels (on average four fold) may occur if ITRACONAZOLE, 200 mg once daily, is administered concomitantly with inhaled BUDESONIDE (single dose of 1000 micrograms). 
> 
β adrenergic blockers can weaken or inhibit the effect of FORMOTEROL. A fixed-dose combination therapy of BUDESONIDE and FORMOTEROL fumarate dihydrate  should therefore not be given together with β  adrenergic blockers (including eye drops) unless there are compelling reasons.
> Concomitant treatment with QUINIDINE, DISOPYRAMIDE, PROCAINAMIDE, phenothiazines, antihistamines (TERFENADINE), monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic ANTIDEPRESSANTS can prolong the QTc-interval and increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. 
> Concomitant treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors including medicinal products with similar properties such as FURAZOLIDONE and PROCARBAZINE may precipitate hypertensive reactions. 
> There is an elevated risk of arrhythmias in p atients receiving concomitant anaesthesia with HALOGENATED HYDROCARBONS.
> Hypokalaemia may increase t he disposition towards arrhythmias in patients who are treated with DIGITALIS GLYCOSIDES.
