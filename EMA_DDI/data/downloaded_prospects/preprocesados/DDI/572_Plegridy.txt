> No interaction studies have been performed. The cl inical studies indicate that multiple sclerosis patients can receive PEGINTERFERON BETA-1A and CORTICOSTEROIDS during relapses. INTERFERONS have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450- dependent ENZYMES in humans and animals. Cautio n should be exercised when peginterferon beta -1a  is administered in combination with medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic cytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. some classes of ANTIEPILEPTICS and ANTIDEPRESSANTS.
