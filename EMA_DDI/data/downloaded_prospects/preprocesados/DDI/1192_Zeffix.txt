> Substances shown to be predominately excreted either via the active organic anionic pathway, or by glomerular filtration are unlikely to yield clinically significant interactions with lamivudine.  Administration of TRIMETHOPRIM/sulphamethoxazole 160 mg/800 mg increased lamivudine exposure by about 40 %. Lamivudine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of TRIMETHOPRIM or sulphamethoxazole. However, un less the patient has renal impairment, no dosage adjustment of lamivudine is necessary. 
> A modest increase in Cmax (28 %) was observed for ZIDOVUDINE when administered with lamivudine, however overall exposure (AUC) was not significantly altered. ZIDOVUDINE had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lamivudine (see section 5.2). 
> In vitro  lamivudine inhibits the intracellular phosphorylation of CLADRIBINE leading to a potential risk of CLADRIBINE loss of efficacy in case of combination in the clinical setting. Some clinical findings also support a possible interaction between lamivudi ne and CLADRIBINE. Therefore, t he concomitant use of lamivudine with CLADRIBINE is not recommended (see section 4.4). 
> Co-administration of sorbitol solution (3.2 g, 10.2 g, 13.4 g) with a single 300 mg dose (Adult HIV daily dose) of lamivudine oral solution resulted in dose -dependent decreases of 14%, 32%, and 36% in lamivudine exposure (AUC âˆž) and 28%, 52%, and 55% in the C max of lamivudine  in adults. When possible, avoid chronic  co-administration  of ZEFFIX w ith medicinal products containing sorbitol  or other osmotic acting poly- alcohols or monosaccharide alcohols (e.g. xylitol , MANNITOL, lactitol, maltitol). C onsider more frequent monitoring of HBV viral load when chronic co- administration cannot be avoided.
