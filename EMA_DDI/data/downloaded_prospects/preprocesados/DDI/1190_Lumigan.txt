> No in teraction studies have been performed.No interactions are anticipated in humans, since systemic concentrations of bimatoprost are extremely low (less than 0.2 ng/ml) following ocular dosing with bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml eye drops, solution. Bimatoprost is b iotransformed by any of multiple ENZYMES and pathways, and no effects on hepatic drug metabolising ENZYMES were observed in preclinical studies. In clinical studies, bimatoprost 0.3 mg/ml, eye drops, solution was used concomitantly with a number of different ophthalmic beta -blocking agents without evidence of interactions. Concomitant use of LUMIGAN and antiglaucomatous agents other than topical beta -blockers has not been evaluated during adjunctive glaucoma therapy. Ther e is a potential for the IOP-lowering effect of PROSTAGLANDIN ANALOGUES (e.g. LUMIGAN) to be reduced in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension when used with other PROSTAGLANDIN ANALOGUES (see section 4.4).
