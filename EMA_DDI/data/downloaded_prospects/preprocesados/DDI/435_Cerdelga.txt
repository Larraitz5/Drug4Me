> After repeated 84  mg twice daily  doses of eliglustat  in non-PMs, concomitant administration with repeated 30  mg once daily  doses of PAROXETINE, a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6, resulted in a 7 .3- and 
8.9-fold increase in eliglustat C max and AUC 0-12, respectively.  A dose of  eliglustat 84 mg once daily should  be considered when a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor  (e.g. PAROXETINE,  FLUOXETINE, QUINIDINE, BUPROPION) is used concomitantly in IMs and EMs. 
> At 84 mg twice daily  dosing with eliglustat  in non -PMs, it is predicted that concomitant use of moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g.  DULOXETINE, TERBINAFINE , MOCLOBEMIDE, MIRABEGRON, CINACALCET , DRONEDARONE ) would increase eliglustat exposure approximately up to 4-fold. Caution should be used with moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors  in IMs and EMs .
> After repeated 84  mg twice daily  doses of eliglustat  in non-PMs, concomitant administration with  repeated 400  mg once daily doses of  KETOCONAZOLE, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A, resulted in a 3.8 and 
4.3-fold increase in eliglustat C max and AUC 0-12, respectively ; similar effects would be expected for other strong  inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g.  CLARITHROMYCIN, KETOCONAZOLE, ITRACONAZOLE , COBICISTAT,  INDINAVIR, LOPINAVIR, RITONAVIR, SAQUINAVIR, TELAPREVIR, TIPRANAVIR, POSACONAZOLE, VORICONAZOLE, TELITHROMYCIN, CONIVAPTAN , BOCEPREVIR ). Caution should be used with strong CYP3A inhibitors  in IMs and EMs .
> At 84  mg twice daily  dosing with eliglustat  in non -PMs, it is predicted that concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g.  ERYTHROMYCIN, CIPROFLOXACIN, FLUCONAZOLE , DILTIAZEM, verap amil, APREPITANT , ATAZANAVIR, DARUNAVIR, FOSAMPRENAVIR, IMATINIB , CIMETIDINE ) would increase eliglustat exposure approximately up to 3-fold. Caution should be used with moderate CYP3A inhibitors  in IMs and EMs .
> At 84 mg once daily dosing with eliglustat  in PMs , it is predicted that concomitant use of strong CYP3A  inhibitors (e.g. KETOCONAZOLE, CLARITHROMYCIN, ITRACONAZOLE, COBICISTAT,  INDINAVIR, LOPINAVIR, RITONAVIR, SAQUINAVIR, TELAPREVIR, TIPRANAVIR, POSACONAZOLE, VORICONAZOLE, TELITHROMYCIN, CONIVAPTAN , boce previr) would increase the C max and AUC 0-24 of eliglustat 4.3 - and 6.2 -fold. The use of strong CYP3A inhibitors is contraindicated in PMs. 
> At 84 mg once daily dosing with eliglustat  in PMs , it is predicted that concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inhibitors  (e.g. ERYTHROMYCIN, CIPROFLOXACIN, FLUCONAZOLE, DILTIAZEM, VERAPAMIL, APREPITANT , ATAZANAVIR, DARUNAVIR, FOSAMPRENAVIR, IMATINIB , CIMETIDINE ) would increase the C max and AUC 0-24 of eliglustat 2.4 - and 3.0 -fold, respectively.  Use of a moderate CYP 3A inhibi tor with eliglustat is not recommended in PMs .
> Strong CYP3A inducers  After  repeated 127  mg twice daily  doses of eliglustat  in non -PMs, concomitant administration of repeated 600 mg once daily  doses of rifampicin (a strong inducer of CYP3A as well as the efflux transporter P -gp) resulted in an approximately 85% decrease in eliglu stat exposure.  After repeated 
84 mg twice daily doses of eliglustat in PMs , concomitant administration of repeated 600  mg once daily  doses of rifampicin resulted in an approximately  95% decrease in eliglustat exposure . Use of a 7 strong CYP3A inducer ( e.g. rifampicin, CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENOBARBITAL, PHENYTOIN, RIFABUTIN and St. Johnâ€™s wort) with eliglustat is not recommended  in IMs, EMs and PMs .
> P-gp substrates  After a single 0.25  mg dose of  DIGOXIN, a P -gp substrate, concomitant administration of 127  mg twice daily  doses of eliglustat  resulted in a 1.7 - and 1.5 -fold increase in DIGOXIN C max and AUC last, respectively. Lower doses of substances which are P-gp substrate s (e.g. DIGOXIN, colchicin e, DABIGATRAN, PHENYTOIN , PRAVASTATIN ) may be required. 
> CYP2D6 substrates  After a single 50  mg dose of METOPROLOL, a CYP2D6 substrate, concomitant administration of repeated 
127 mg twice daily  doses of eliglustat resulted in a 1.5 - and 2.1 -fold increase i n METOPROLOL C max and AUC, respectively. Lower doses of medicinal products that are CYP2D6 substrate s may be required . These include certain ANTIDEPRESSANTS (tricyclic ANTIDEPRESSANTS, e.g.  NORTRIPTYLINE, AMITRIPTYLINE, IMIPRAMINE , and DESIPRAMINE ), phenothiazines, DEXTROMETHORPHAN and ATOMOXETINE ).
