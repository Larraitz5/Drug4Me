> R-and S-WARFARIN. Co-administration ofasingle 25mgdose of WARFARIN hadnoeffect on thepharmacokinetics oflenalidomide. However, itis notknown whether thereisaninteraction during clinical use(concomitant treatment with DEXAMETHASONE). DEXAMETHASONE is a weakto moderate enzyme inducer anditseffect onwarfarin isunknown. Close monitoring ofwarfarinconcentration is advised during thetreatment.DIGOXIN
> Concomitant administration with LENALIDOMIDE 10mg once daily increased theplasma exposure ofdigoxin (0.5mg,single dose) by14% witha 90% CI(confidence interval)[0.52% -28.2%]. Itis notknown whether theeffect willbe different intheclinical use(higher LENALIDOMIDE doses andconcomitant treatment with DEXAMETHASONE). Therefore, monitoring ofthedigoxin concentration isadvised during LENALIDOMIDE treatment.Statins
> There isan increased riskofrhabdomyolysis when statins areadministered with LENALIDOMIDE, whichmaybe simply additive. Enhanced clinical andlaboratory monitoring is warranted notably during thefirstweeks oftreatment.DEXAMETHASONE
> P-gp,butisnota P-gpinhibitor. Co-administration ofmultipledoses ofthe strong P-gpinhibitor QUINIDINE (600 mg,twice daily) orthe moderate P-gpinhibitor/substrate TEMSIROLIMUS (25mg)has no clinically relevant effect onthepharmac okinetics oflenalidomide (25mg).Co-administration oflenalidomide does notalter thepharmacokinetics oftemsirolimus.
