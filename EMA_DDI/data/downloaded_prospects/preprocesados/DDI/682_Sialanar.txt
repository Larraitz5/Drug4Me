> POTASSIUM CHLORIDE solid oral dose  Glycopyrronium may potentiate the risk of upper gastrointestinal injury associated with oral solid formulations of POTASSIUM CHLORIDE due to increased gastrointestinal transit time creating a high localized concentration of POTASSIUM ions. An association with upper gast rointestinal  bleeding and small bowel ulceration, stenosis, perforation, and obstruction has been observed.   ANTICHOLINERGICS  Concomitant use of ANTICHOLINERGICS may increase the risk of anticholinergic side effects. ANTICHOLINERGICS may delay the gastroi ntestinal absorption of other ANTICHOLINERGICS administered orally and also increase the risk of anticholinergic side effects. 
> OPIOIDS  Active substances such as pethidine and CODEINE may result in additive CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM and gastrointestinal adverse effects, and increase the risk of severe constipation or paralytic ileus and CNS depression. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, patients should be monitored for potentially excessive or prolonged CNS depression and constipation.
> CORTICOSTEROIDS  Steroid -induced glaucoma may develop with topical, inhaled, oral or intravenous, steroid administration. Concomitant use may result in increased intraocular pressure via an open - or a closed -angle mechanism.
> Medicinal products with anticholinergic properties (e.g. antihistamines, ANTIDEPRESSANTS) may cause cumulative parasympatholytic effects including dry mouth, urinary retention, constipation and confusion, and an increased risk of anticholinergic intoxication syndrome.
