> Although concomitant administration of inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase (e.g. METHOTREXATE, TRIMETHOPRIM) has not been studied, such medicinal  products may interfere with BH4 metabolism. Caution is recommended when using such medicinal products  while taking KUVAN. 
> BH4 is a cofactor for NITRIC OXIDE synthetase. Caution is recommended during concomitant use of KUVAN with all medicinal products  that cause vasodilation, including those administered topically, by affecting NITRIC OXIDE (NO) metabolism or action including classical NO donors (e.g. glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), ISOSORBIDE DINITRATE (ISDN), sodium NITROPRUSSIDE (SNP), molsidomin), phosphod iesterase type 5  (PDE -5) inhibitors and MINOXIDIL. 
>  
8 Caution should be exercised when prescribing KUVAN to patients receiving treatment with LEVODOPA. Cases of convulsion, exacerbation of convulsion, increased excitability and irritability have been observe d during co-administration of LEVODOPA and sapropterin in BH4- deficient patients.
