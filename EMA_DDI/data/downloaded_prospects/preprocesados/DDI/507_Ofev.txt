> P-glycoprotein (P -gp)Nintedanib is a substrate of P -gp (see section 5.2). Co -administration with the potent P -gp inhibitor KETOCONAZOLE increased exposure to nintedanib 1.61 -fold based on AUC and 1.83 -fold based on C maxin a dedicated drug -drug interaction study. In a drug -drug interaction study with the potent P -gp inducer rifampicin, exposure to nintedanib decreased to 50.3% based on AUC and to 60.3% based on Cmaxupon co -administration with rifampicin compared to administration of nintedanib alone. If co -administered with OFEV, potent P -gp inhibitors (e.g. KETOCONAZOLE ,ERYTHROMYCIN or CYCLOSPORINE ) may increase exposure to nintedanib. In such cases, patients should be monitored closely for tolerability of nintedanib. Management of adverse reactions may require interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation of therapy with OFEV (see section 4.2).7Potent P -gp inducers (e.g. rifampicin, CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENYTOIN, and St. Johnâ€™s Wort) may decrease exposure t o nintedanib. Selection of an alternate concomitant medicinal product with no or minimal P-gp induction potential should be considered.Cytochrome (CYP) -ENZYMES
> Only a mino r extent of the biotransformation of nintedanib consisted of CYP pathways. Nintedanib and its metabolites, the free acid moiety BIBF 1202 and its glucuronide BIBF 1202 glucuronide, did not inhibit or induce CYP ENZYMES in p reclinical studies (see section 5.2). The likelihood of drug -drug interactio ns with nintedanib based on CYP metabolism is therefore considered to be low.Co-administration with other medicinal products
> Co-administration of nintedanib with oral hormonal contraceptives did not alter the ph armacokinetics of oral hormonal contraceptives to a relevant extent (see section 5.2).Co-administration of nintedanib with BOSENTAN did not alter the pharmacokinetics of nintedanib (see section 5.2).
