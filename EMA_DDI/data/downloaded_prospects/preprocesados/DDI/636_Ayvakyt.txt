> Strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors  Co-administration of avapritinib  with a strong CYP3A inhibitor increased avapritinib plasma concentrations and may result in increased adverse reactions. Co -administration of ITRACONAZOLE (200 mg twice daily on Day  1 followed by 200  mg once daily for 13  days) with a single 200  mg dose of avapritinib on Day  4 in healthy subjects increased avapritinib C max by 1.4-fold and AUC 0-inf by 
4.2-fold, relative to a 200  mg dose of avapritinib administered alone. 
> Concomitant use of avapritinib with strong  or moderate  CYP3A inhibitors (such as antifungals including KETOCONAZOLE, ITRACONAZOLE, POSACONAZOLE, VORICONAZOLE; certain MACROLIDES such as  ERYTHROMYCIN,  CLARITHROMYCIN and TELITHROMYCIN; active substances to treat human immunodeficiency virus infections/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) such as COBICISTAT, INDINAVIR, LOPINAVIR, NELFINAVIR, RITONAVIR and SAQUINAVIR; as well as CONIVAPTAN for hyponatremia and BOCEPREVIR to treat hepatitis) including grapefruit  or GRAPEFRUIT JUICE should be avoided. If concomitant use with a moderate CYP3A inhibitor cannot be avoided, the starting dose of avapritinib  should be reduced from 
300 mg to 100  mg orally once daily for patients with GIST, and from 200  mg to 50 mg orally once daily for patients with Adv
> Co-administration of avapritinib  with strong and moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g. DEXAMETHASONE, PHENYTOIN, CARBAMAZEPINE, rifampicin, PHENOBARBITAL, FOSPHENYTOIN, PRIMIDONE, BOSENTAN, EFAVIRENZ, ETRAVIRINE, MODAFINIL, DABRAFENIB, NAFCILLIN or Hypericum perforatum , also known as St. Johnâ€™s wort) should be avoided.
