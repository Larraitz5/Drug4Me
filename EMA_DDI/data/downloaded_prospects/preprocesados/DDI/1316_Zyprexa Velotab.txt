> Induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking and CARBAMAZEPINE, which may lead to reduced olanzapine c oncentration s. Only sli ght to moder ate increase in olanzapine clearance has been observed. The clinical consequences are likely to be limited, but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase of olanzapine dose may be considered if necessary (see sec tion 4.2).
> Inhibition of CYP1A2 Fluvox amin e, a specific CYP1A2 inhibitor, has been shown to significantly inhibit the metabolism of olanzapine. The mean increase in olanzapine C max following FLUVOXAMINE was 54 % in female non-smokers and 77 % in male smok ers. The mea n increase i n olanzapin e AUC wa s 52 % and 108 % respectively. A lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using FLUVOXAMINE or any other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as CIPROFLOXACIN. A decrease in the dose of olanzapine should be considere d if tr eatm ent with  an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated.
