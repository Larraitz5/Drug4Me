> No interaction studies have been performed (see section 5.2).Based on in vitro data, coadministration of INOTUZUMAB OZOGAMICIN with inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 (CYP) or URIDINE diphosphate -glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) drug metabolising ENZYMES are unlikely to alter exposure to N -acetyl -gamma -calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide . In addition, INOTUZUMAB OZOGAMICIN and N -acetyl -gamma -calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide are unlikely to alter the exposure of substrates of CYP ENZYMES, and N -acetyl -gamma -calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide is unlikely to alter the exposure of substrates of UGT ENZYMES or major drug transporters.In patients receiving INOTUZUMAB OZOGAMICIN ,prolonged QT interval was observed (see section 4.4) . Therefore, the concomitant use of INOTUZUMAB OZOGAMICIN with medicinal products known to prolong QT interval or to induce Torsades de P ointes should be carefully considered. The QT interval should be mo nitored in case of combinations of such medicinal products ( see section s4.4, 4.8,and 5.2 ).
