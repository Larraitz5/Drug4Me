> No data on concomitant administration of TWINRIX PAEDIATRIC with specific hepatit is A immunoglobulin or hepatitis B immunoglobulin have been generated.  However, when the monovalent hepatitis A and hepatitis B VACCINES were administered concomitantly with SPECIFIC IMMUNOGLOBULINS, no influence on seroconversion was observed although it  may result in lower antibody tit res.
> TWINRIX PAEDIATRIC can be given concomitantly with Human Papillomavirus  (HPV) vaccine.  Administration of Twinrix  Paediatric at the same time as CERVARIX (HPV vaccine) has shown no clinically relevant interference in t he antibody response to the HPV and hepatitis A antigens. Anti -HBs geometric mean antibody concentrations were lower on co- administration, but the clinical significance of this observation is not known since the seroprotection rates remain unaffected. The proportion of subjects reaching anti -HBs â‰¥  10 m
> Only the concomitant administration of TWINRIX PAEDIATRIC with CERVARIX has  been specifically studied. It is advised that VACCINES other  than CERVARIX should not be administered at the same time as TWINRIX PAEDIATRIC.
