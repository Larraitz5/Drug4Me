> CYP3A4 /5 inhibitors  KETOCONAZOLE, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4/5, administered at a dose of 400  mg once daily for 
7 days, increased th e mea n area under the curve  (AUC ) 2-fold and C max 1.5-fold of a single 5 -mg oral dose of axitinib  in he althy volunteers. Co -administration of axitinib with strong  CYP3A4 /5 inhibitors (e.g. KETOCONAZOLE, ITRACONAZOLE, CLARITHROMYCIN, ERYTHROMYCIN, atazanavi r, INDINAVIR, NEFAZODONE, NELFINAVIR, RITONAVIR, SAQUINAVIR, and TELITHROMYCIN) may increase axitinib  plasma concentrations. Grapefruit may also increase axitinib plasma  concentrations. Selection of concomitant medicin al products  with no or minimal CYP3A4/ 5 inhibition potential is r ecommended. If a strong CYP3A4/5  inhibitor must be co -administered , a dose adjustment  of axitinib is recommended  (see section  4.2).
> Co-administration of axitinib with strong  CYP3A4/5  inducers (e. g. rifampi cin, DEXAMETHASONE, PHENYTOIN, CARBAMAZEPINE, RIFABUTIN, rifapentin, PHENOBARBITAL, and Hypericum perforatum  [St. Johnâ€™ s wort]) may decrease axitinib plasma concentrations.  Selection of concomitant medicin al products  with 8 no or minimal CYP3A4/5  induction potential is recommended. If a strong CYP3A4/5 inducer must be co-administered , a dose adjustment of axitinib is recomme nded (see sec tion 4.2).
> In vitro  studie s indicated t hat axitinib has a potential to inhibit CYP1A2. Therefore, co -administration of axitini b with CYP1A2 substrates ma y result in increased plasma concentrations of CYP1A2  substrates (e.g. THEOPHYLLINE). 
> In vitro  studies also indicated that axit inib h as the potential to inhibit CYP2C8. However, co-administration of axitinib with PACLITAXEL, a known  CYP2C8 substrate, did  not result in increased plasma concentrations of PACLITAXEL in patients with advanced cancer , indicating lack of clinical CYP2C8  inhib ition. 
> In vitro studies with P -glycoprotein  In vitro  studies indicated that a xitinib inhibits P -glycopro tein. However, axitinib is not expected to inhibit P -glycoprotein at therapeutic plasma  concentrations . Therefore, co-administrat ion of axitin ib is not expected to increase  the plasma concentration  of DIGOXIN, or other P-glycopro tein substrates , in vivo.
