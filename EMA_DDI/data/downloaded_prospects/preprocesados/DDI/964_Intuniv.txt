> When GUANFACINE is used concomitantly with CYP3A4/ 5 inhibitors orinducers, plasma concentrations of GUANFACINE may be elevated or lowered, potentially affecting the efficacy and safety of GUANFACINE . GUANFACINE can increase plasma concentrations of concomitantly administered medic inal products that are m etabolis ed via CYP3A4/5 (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and5.2).GUANFACINE is an in vitro inhibitor of MATE1 and the clinical relevance of MATE1 inhibition cannot be excluded. Concomitant administration of GUANFACINE with MATE1 substrates may result in 8increases in the plasma concentrations of these medicinal products. Furthermore, based on in vitrostudies, GUANFACINE may be an inhibitor of OCT1 at maximal portal vein concentrations. Concomitant administration of GUANFACINE with OCT1 substrates with a similar T max(e.g., METFORMIN) may result in increases in C maxof these medicinal products.The pharmacodynamic effect of GUANFACINE can have an additive effect when taken with other products known to cause sedat ion, hypotension or QT prolongation (see section 4.4).Interaction studies have only been performed in adults .However, the outcome is expected to be similar in the indicated paediatric age range.QT prolonging medicinal products
> GUANFACINE causes a decrease in heart rate. Given the effect of GUANFACINE on heart rate, the concomitant use of GUANFACINE with QT prolonging medicinal products is generally not recommended(see section 4.4).CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 inhibitors
> Caution should be used when GUANFACINE is administered to patients taking KETOCONAZOLE and other moderate and strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, a decrease in the dose of GUANFACINE within the recommended dose range is proposed (see section 4.2). Co-administration of GUANFACINE with moderate and strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors elevat esplasma GUANFACINE con centration s and increases the risk of adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, and sedation. There was a substantial increase in the rate and extent of GUANFACINE exposure when administered with KETOCONAZOLE; the GUANFACINE peak plasma concentra tions (C max) and exposure (AUC) increased 2-and 3-fold, respectively .Other CYP3A4/5 inhibitors may have a comparable effect, s ee table 3 for a list of examples of moderate and strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, this list is not definitive.CYP3A4 inducers
> Whe n patients are taking GUANFACINE concomitantly with a CYP3A4 inducer, an increase in the dose of GUANFACINE within the recommended dose range is proposed (see section 4.2). There was a significant decrease in the rate and extent of GUANFACINE exposure when co-administered with rifamp icin, a CYP3A4 inducer. The peak plasma concentrations (C max) and exposure (AUC) ofguanfacine decreased by 54%and 70% respectively .Other CYP3A4 inducers may have a comparable effect, s ee table 3 for a list of examples of CYP3 A4/5 in ducers , this list is not definitive.Table 3Moderate CYP3A4/5 inhibitors
> Co-administration of GUANFACINE and VALPROIC ACID can result in increased concentrations of VALPROIC ACID. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown, although both GUANFACINE and VALPROIC ACID are metabolised by glucuronidation, possibly resulting in competitive inhibition. When GUANFACINE is co-administered with VALPROIC ACID, patients should be monitored for potential additive CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (CNS) effects and consideration should be given to the monitoring of serum VALPROIC ACID concentrations. Adjustments in the dose of VALPROIC ACID and GUANFACINE may be indicated when co -administered.Antihypertensive medicinal produ cts
> In aninteraction study, neither GUANFACINE nor O smotic Release Oral System (OROS) -METHYLPHENIDATE HCl extended -release were found to affect the pharmacokinetics of the other medicinal products when taken in combination .LISDEXAMFETAMINE dimesylate
> Ina drug interaction study, administration of GUANFACINE in combination with LISDEXAMFETAMINE dimesylate induced a 19% increase in GUANFACINE maximum plasma concentrations, whereas e xposure (AUC) was increased by 7%. These small changes are not expect ed to be clinically meaningful. In this study, no effect on d -AMPHETAMINE exposure was observed following combination of GUANFACINE and LISDEXAMFETAMINE dimesylate.Food interactions
> GUANFACINE should not be administered with high fat meals due to increased exposure , as ithas been shown that high fat meals havea significant effect on the absorption of GUANFACINE (see section 4.2) .
