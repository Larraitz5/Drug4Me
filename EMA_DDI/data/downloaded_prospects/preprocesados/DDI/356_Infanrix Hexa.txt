> Increased reporting rates of convulsions (with or without fever) and hypotonic hyporesponsive episode (HHE) were obse rved with concomitant administration of INFANRIX HEXA and PREVENAR 13 (see section 
4.8).
> Clinical data  indicate that INFANRIX HEXA  can be given to preterm infants, however, as expected in  this population, a lower immune response has  been observed for some antigens (see section 4.8 and section 
5.1).
> Data have shown no clinically relevant interference in the antibody response to each of the individual antigens , although inconsistent antibody response to poliovirus type 2 in co- administration with SYNFLORIX was observed (seroprotection ranging from 78% to 100%)  and the immune response rates to the PRP (Hib) antigen of INFANRIX HEXA after 2 doses given at 2 and 4 m onths of age were higher if co -administered with a TETANUS TOXOID conjugate pneumococcal or meningococcal vaccine (see section 5.1). The clinical relevance of th ese observation s remain s unknown. 
> Data from clinical studies indicate that, when INFANRIX HEXA is co -administered with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine s, the rate of febrile reactions is higher compared to that occurring following the administration of INFANRIX HEXA alone. Dat a from one clinical study indicate that when INFANRIX HEXA is co-administered with MMRV vaccine, the rate of febrile reactions is higher compared to that occurring following the administration of INFANRIX HEXA alone and similar to that occurring following the administration of MMRV vaccine alone (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). The immune responses were unaffected. 
> Due to an increased risk of fever, pain at the injection site, appetite lost and irritability when INFANRIX HEXA  was co -administered with Men
