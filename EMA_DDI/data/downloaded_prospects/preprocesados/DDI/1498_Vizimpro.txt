> Co-administration of  DACOMITINIB with agent s that increase gast ric p
> H resulting in higher solubility. Data from a study in  24 healthy subjects indicated that co-administration of a single 45 mg DACOMITINIB dose with the PPI rab eprazole 40 mg o nce daily for 7 days decreased DACOMITINIB C max, AUC 0-96h (area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to 96 hour s), and AUC inf (AUC from time 0 to infinity) (n=14) by approximately 51%, 39%, and 29%, respectively, when compared to a single 45 mg dose of d acomitinib administere d alone. PPIS shoul d be avoided while receiving treatment with dacomiti nib (see section 4.4).
> Co-administration of DACOMITINIB and CY P2D6 substrates
> Co-administratio n of single 45 mg oral dose of DACOMITINIB incr eased the mean exposure (AUC last and Cmax) of DEXTROMETHORPHAN, a probe C YP2D6 substrate, 855% and 874%,  respectively, compared with administration of DEXTROMETHORPHAN alone. These results suggest  that DACOMITINIB may increase exposure of other medicinal products (or decrease exposure to a ctive metabolites) primarily metabolised by CYP2D6. Concomitant use of  medicinal products predominantly metabolised by CYP2D6 should be avoided (see section 4.4). If concomitant use of such medicinal products is considered necessary, they should follow their respective label s for dose recommendation regarding co-administration with s trong CYP2D6 inhibitors.
