> Concomitant administration of orally inhaled INDACATEROL and glycopyrronium, under steady -state conditions  of both active substances , did not affect the pharmacokine tics of either active substance .
> Sympathomimetic s Concomitant administration of other sympathomimetic s (alone or as part of combination therapy) may potentiate the adverse events  of INDACATEROL  (see section  4.4).
> Hypokalaemic treatment  Concomitant hypokalaemic treatment with methylxanthine derivatives, steroids, or non -POTASSIUM -sparing DIURETICS may potentiate the possible hypokalaemic effect of beta 2-adrenergic agonists , therefor e use with caution (see section  4.4).
> Metabolic and transporter based interaction s Inhibition of the key contributors of INDACATEROL clearance, CYP3A4 and P -glycoprotein (P -gp), raises the systemic e xposure of INDACATEROL up to two-fold. Th e magnitude of exposure increases due to interactions does not raise any safety concerns given the safety experience of treatment with INDACATEROL in clinical studies of up to one year at doses up to twice the maximum recommended INDACATEROL dose.
> Cimetid ine or other inhibitors of organic cation transport  In a clinical study in healthy volunteers, CIMETIDINE, an inhibitor of organic cation transport which is thought to contribute to the renal excretion of glycopyrronium, increased total exposure (AUC) to glycopyrronium by 22% and decreased renal clearance by 23%. Based on the magnitude of these changes, no clinically relevant drug interaction is expected when glycopyrronium is co -administered with CIMETIDINE or other inhibitors of the organic cation transport.
