> Interactions can occur with medicinal products  that induce microsomal ENZYMES , result ing in increased clearance of sex hormones, which may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. 
> Medicinal products  increasing the clearance of C HCs (enzyme- induction), e.g.:  barbiturates, BOSENTAN, CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENYTOIN, PRIMIDONE, rifampicin and HIV medicinal products  (e.g. RITONAVIR, NEVIRAPINE and EFAVIRENZ ) and possibly also FELBAMATE, griseof ulvin, OXCARBAZEPINE, TOPIRAMATE and products containing the herbal ST. JOHN'S WORT ( Hypericum perforatum ). 
> Medicinal products  with variable effects on the clearance of C HCs: When co -administered with C HCs, many combinations of HIV PROTEASE INHIBITORS and non- nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, including combinations with HCV inhibitors can increase or decrease plasma concentrations of oestrogens and PROGESTOGENS . The effect of these changes may be clinically relevant in some cases. 
> Medicinal products  decreasing the clearance of C HCs (ENZYME INHIBITORS):   
13 The clinical relevance of potential interactions with ENZYME INHIBITORS remains unknown. Concomi tant administration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors can increase plasma concentrations of oestrogens or PROGESTOGENS  or both.
> - Potential interactions with DROSPIRENONE  In a multiple dose study with a DROSPIRENONE (3 mg/day)  / ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg/day) combination, co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor KETOCONAZOLE for 10 days increased the area under the curve during a 24- hour period ( AUC(0-24 h)) of DROSPIRENONE (and ethinylestradiol ) 2.7- fold (and 
1.4-fold, respectively). 
> Oral contraceptives may affect the metabolism of certain other active substances. Accordingly, plasma and tissue concentrations may either increase (e.g., CICLOSPORIN) or decrease ( e.g., LAMOTRIGINE). 
> Concomitant use with the HCV medicinal products containing OMBITASVIR/PARITAPREVIR/RITONAVIR and DASABUVIR, with or without RIBAVIRIN, may increase the risk of ALT elevations in women using ethinylestradiol containing  medicinal products  such as CHCs (see section  4.4). Women using medicinal products containing oestrogens other than ethinylestradiol, had a rate of ALT elevation similar to those not receiving any oestrogens; however, due to the limited number of women taking these other oestrogen s, caution is warranted for co -administration with the combination therapeutic regimen OMBITASVIR/PARITAPREVIR/RITONAVIR and DASABUVIR with or without RIBAVIRIN and also the regimen with GLECAPREVIR/PIBRENTASVIR  or SOFOSBUVIR/VELPATASVIR/VOXILAPREVIR  (see section 4.4) .
> In patients without renal impairment , the concomitant use of DROSPIRENONE and angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE )-inhibitors or non- steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) did not show a significant effect on serum POTASSIUM. Nevertheless, concomitant use of DROVELIS  with ALDOSTERONE ANTAGONISTS or POTASSIUM -sparing DIURETICS has not been studied. In this case, serum POTASSIUM should be tested during the first treatment cyc le. See also section  4.4.
