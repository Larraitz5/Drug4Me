> Interactions can occur with medicinal products  that induce microsomal ENZYMES , result ing in increased clearance of sex hor mones, which may le ad to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. 
> Medicinal  produc ts increasing the clearance of C HCs (enzyme- induction), e.g.:  barbiturates, BOSENTAN, CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENYTOIN, PRIMIDONE, rifampicin and HI V medicinal products  (e.g. RITONAVIR, NEVIRAPINE a nd EFAVIRENZ ) and possibly also FELBAMATE, GRISEOFULVIN, OXCARBAZEPINE, TOPIRAMATE and products containing the herbal ST. JOHN'S WORT ( Hypericum perforatum ). 
> Medicinal products  with variable effects on th e clearance of C HCs: When co -administered with C HCs, many combi nations of HIV PROTEASE INHIBITORS and non- nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, including c ombinations with HCV inhibitors can increase or decrease plasma concentrations of oestrogens and PROGESTOGENS . The effect of these changes may be clinically relevant in some cases. 
> Medicinal products  decreasing the clearance of C HCs (ENZYME INHIBITORS):  The clin ical relevance of potential int eractions with enzy me inhibitors remains unknown. Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors can increase plasma concen trations of oestrogens or PROGESTOGENS  or both.

- Potential interactions with DROSPIRENONE  In a multiple dose study with a dro spirenone (3 mg/day ) / ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg/day) combination, co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor KETOCONAZOLE for 10  days increased the area under the curve during a 24- hour period ( AUC (0-24 h)) of drospire none (and ethinylestradiol ) 2.7- fold (and 
1.4-fold, respectively). 
> Oral contraceptives may affect the metabolism of certain other active substances. Accordingly, plasma and tissue concentrations may either increase (e.g., CICLOSPORIN) or decrease (e.g., LAMOTRIGINE). 
> Concomitant us e with the HCV medi cinal products containing OMBITASVIR/PARITAPREVIR/RITONAVIR  and DASABUVIR, with or without RIBAVIRIN, may increase the risk of ALT  elevations in women using ethinylestradiol containing  medicinal products  such as CHCs  (see section  4.4). Women using medicina l products containing oestrogens other than ethinyle stradio l, had a rate of ALT elevation similar to those not receiving any oestr ogens; however, due to the limited number of women taking these other oestro gens, caution is warranted for co -administration w ith the combination therapeuti c regimen OMBITASVIR/paritapr evir/RITONAVIR and DASABUVIR with or without RIBAVIRIN and also the regim en with GLECAPREVIR/PIBRENTASVIR  or SOFOSBUVIR/VELPATASVIR/VOXILAPREVIR  (see section 4.4) .
> In patients w ithout r enal impairment , the concomitant use of DROSPIRENONE and angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE )-inhibitors or non- steroida l anti- inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) did not show a significant effect on serum POTASSIUM. Nevertheless, concomitant use of Droveli s with a ldosterone antagonists or POTASSIUM -sparing DIURETICS has not  been studied. In this case, serum POTASSIUM sho uld be tes ted during the first treatment cycle. See also section  4.4.
