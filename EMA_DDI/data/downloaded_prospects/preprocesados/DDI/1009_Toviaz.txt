> Following inhibition of CYP3A4 by co -administration of KETOCONAZOLE 200 mg twice daily, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of FESOTERODINE increased 2.0 and 2.3 -fold in CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers and 2.1 and 2.5 -fold in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, respectively. Therefore, the maximum dose of FESOTERODINE should be restricted to 4 mg when used concomitantly with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ATAZANAVIR, CLARITHROMYCIN, INDINAVIR, ITRACONAZOLE, KETOCONAZOLE, NEFAZODONE, NELFINAVIR, RITONAVIR (and all RITONAVIR boosted PI -regimens), saquin avir and TELITHROMYCIN (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors
> Following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor FLUCONAZOLE 
200mg twice a day for 2 days, C maxand AUC of the active metabolite of FESOTERODINE increased approximately 19% and 27%, respectively. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ERYTHROMYCIN, FLUCONAZOLE, diltia zem, VERAPAMIL and GRAPEFRUIT JUICE).Weak CYP3A4 inhibitors
> Following induction of CYP3A4 b y coadministration of rifampicin 600 mg once a day, C maxand AUC of the active metabolite of FESOTERODINE decreased by approximately 70% and 75%, respectively, after oral administration of FESOTERODINE 8 mg.Induction of CYP3A4 may lead to subtherapeutic plasma levels. Concomitant use with CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. CARBAMAZEPINE, rifampicin, PHENOBARBITAL, PHENYTOIN, St Johnâ€™s Wort) is not recommended (see section 4.4).CYP2D6 inhibitors
