> It is not known if DALBAVANCIN is a substrate for hepatic upt ake and efflux transporters. Co-administration with inhibitors of these transporters may increase the exposu re to DALBAVANCIN. Examples of such transporter inhibitors are boosted PROTEASE INHIBITORS, VERAPAMIL, QUINIDINE, ITRACONAZOLE, CLARITHROMYCIN and CYCLOSPORINE. 
> It is not known if DALBAVANCIN is an inhibitor of transporters. Increased exposure to transporter substrates sensitive for inhibited transporter activity, such as statins and DIGOXIN, cannot be excluded if combined with DALBAVANCIN.
