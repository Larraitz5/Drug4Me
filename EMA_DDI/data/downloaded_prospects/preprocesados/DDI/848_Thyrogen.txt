> The use of THYROGEN allows for radioiodine imaging while patients are euthyroid on THYROID hormone suppression treatment. Data on radioiodine kinetics indicate that the clearance of radioiodine is approximately 50% greater while euthyroid than during the hypothyroid state when renal function is decreased, thus resulting in le ss radioiodine retention in the body at the time of imaging. This factor should be considered when selecting the activity of radioiodine for use in radioiodine imaging.
