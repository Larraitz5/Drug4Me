> Inhibition of CYP1A2  FLUVOXAMINE, a specific CYP1A2 inhibitor, has been shown to significantly inhibit the metabolism of  olanzapine. The mean increase in olanzapine C max following fl uvoxamine was 54 % in female non -smokers and 77  % in male smokers. The mean increase in olanzapine AUC was 52 % and 108 % respectively. A lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using FLUVOXAMINE or any other CYP1A2 inhib itors, such as CIPROFLOXACIN. A decrease in the dose of olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated.
