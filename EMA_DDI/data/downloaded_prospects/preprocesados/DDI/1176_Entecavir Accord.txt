> Since entecavir is predominantly eliminated by the kidney (see section  5.2), coadministration with medicinal products that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase serum concentrations of either medicinal prod uct. Apart from LAMIVUDINE, ADEFOVIR DIPIVOXIL and TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL FUMARATE, the effects of coadministration of entecavir with medicinal products that are excreted renally or affect renal function have not been evaluated. Patients should be monitored closely for adverse reactions when entecavir is coadministered with such medicinal products.
