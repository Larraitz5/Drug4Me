> In a study in RA patients, levels of SIMVASTATIN (CYP3A4) were decreased by 57% one week following a single dose of tocilizumab, to the l evel similar to, or slightly higher than, those observed in healthy subjects. 
> When starting or stopping therapy with tocilizumab , patients taking medicinal products which are individually adjusted and are metabolised via CYP450 3A4, 1A2 or 2C9 (e.g. METHYLPREDNISOLONE, DEXAMETHASONE, (with the possibility for oral glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome), ATORVASTATIN, CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS, THEOPHYLLINE, WARFARIN, PHENPROCOUMON, PHENYTOIN, CICLOSPORIN, or benzodiazepines) should be monitored as doses may ne ed to be increased to maintain therapeutic effect. Given its long elimination half -life (t1/2), the effect of tocilizumab on CYP450 enzyme activity may persist for several weeks after stopping therapy.
