> Co-administration of OSILODROSTAT with other therapies known to affect the QT interval can lead to QT prolongation in patients with known cardiac rhythm disorders (see sections  4.4 and 5.1). A washout period should be considered when switching from other products known to affect the QT interval such as PASIREOTIDE or KETOCONAZOLE. 
> In a healthy volunteer study (n=24), OSILODROSTAT (30 mg twice daily for 7 days before concomitant administration with a combined oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl oestradiol and 0.15 mg LEVONORGESTREL and continued for another 5 days ) did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the AUC and Cmax of ETHINYL ESTRADIOL (geometric mean ratio: 1.03 and 0.88, respectively) and AUC of LEVONORGESTREL (geometric mean ratio: 1.02). The C max of LEVONORGESTREL fel l slightly outside the bioequivalence acceptance range (geometric mean ratio: 0.86; 90% confi dence interval : 0.737- 1.00) . The effects of a longer induction period and an interaction with other  hormonal contraceptives ha ve not been studied (see also section s 4.4 and 4.6).
