> 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  No interaction studies have been performed.  Trientine has been found to reduce serum IRON levels, possibly by reducing its absorption, and IRON supplements may be required. Since IRON and trientine may inhibit absorption of each other, IRON supplements should be taken after at least two hours have elapsed from the administration of trientine.  As trientine is poorly absorbed following oral intake and the principal mechanism of action requires its systemic exposure (see section 5.1), it is important that the film-coated tablets are taken on empty stomach at least one hour before meals or 2 hours after meals and at least one hour apart from any other medicinal product, food, or milk (see section 4.2). This maximises the absorption of trientine and reduces the likelihood of the medicinal product binding to metals in the gastrointestinal tract. However, no food interaction studies have been performed and so the extent of the food effect on systemic trientine exposure is unknown.   Although there is no evidence that CALCIUM or MAGNESIUM ANTACIDS alter the efficacy of trientine, it is good practice to separate their administration.
