> Many of these interactions have been partially confirmed by in vitro studies and in clinical trials. The increase in steady state levels with the combined use of stiripentol , valproate, and CLOBAZAM is similar in adults and children, though inter -individual variability is marked. 
> Caution must be exercised if clinical circumstances require combining stiripentol with substance s metabolised by CYP2C19 (e.g. CITALOPRAM, OMEPRAZOLE) or CYP3A4 (e.g. HIV PROTEASE INHIBITORS, antihistamines such as ASTEMIZOLE  and chlorphe niramine, CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS, statins, oral contraceptives, CODEINE) due to the increased risk of adverse reactions  (see further in this section for antiepileptic medicines ). Monitoring of plasma concentrations or adverse reactions  is recommended. A dose adjustment may be necessary. 
> Data on the potential for inhibition of CYP1A2 are limited, and therefore, interactions with THEOPHYLLINE and CAFFEINE cannot be excluded  because of the i ncreased plasma levels of THEOPHYLLINE and CAFFEINE which may occur via inhibition of their hepatic metabolism, potentially leading to toxicity. Use in combination wi th stiripentol is not recommended. This warning is not only restricted to medicinal products but also to a considerable number of foods  (for example: cola, chocolate, coffee, tea, and energy drinks)  and nutritional products aimed at children : Patient shoul d not drink cola drinks, which contain significant quantities of CAFFEINE or chocolate, which contains trace amounts of THEOPHYLLINE  (see section 4.2) .
> 
- CISAPRIDE, HALOFANTRINE, PIMOZIDE, QUINIDINE, BEPRIDIL  Increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and torsades de pointes/wave burst arrhythmia in particular .
> 
- IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS (TACROLIMUS, CYCLOSPORINE, SIROLIMUS)  Raised blood levels of IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS (decreased hepatic metabolism). 
> 
- Statins (ATORVASTATIN, SIMVASTATIN, etc.)  Increased risk of dose -dependent adverse reactions such as rhabdomyolysis ( decreased hepatic metabolism of cholesterol -lowering medicinal product ).
> 
- MIDAZOLAM, TRIAZOLAM, ALPRAZOLAM  Increased plasma benzodiazepine levels may occur via decreased hepatic metabolism leading to excessive sedation .
> 
- Effects on other antiepileptic drugs ( AEDs ) Inhibition of CYP450 isoenzyme CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 may provoke pharmacokinetic interactions (inhibition of their hepatic  metabolism) with PHENOBARBITAL, PRIMIDONE, PHENYTOIN, CARBAMAZEPINE, CLOBAZAM (see section  4.2), valproate (see section  4.2), DIAZEPAM (enhanced myorelaxation), ETHOSUXIMIDE, and TIAGABINE. The consequences are increased plasma levels of these anticonvuls ants with potential risk of overdose. Clinical monitoring of plasma levels of other anticonvulsants when combined with stiripentol with possible dose adjustments is recommended. 
> 
- TOPIRAMATE  In a French compassionate use program for stiripentol, topiramat e was added to stiripentol, CLOBAZAM and valproate in 41% of 230  cases. Based on the clinical observations in this group of patients, there is no evidence to suggest that a change in TOPIRAMATE dose and dosage schedules is needed if co -administered with st iripentol.  With regard to TOPIRAMATE, it is considered that potential competition of inhibition on CYP2C19 should not occur because it probably requires plasma concentrations 5 -15 times higher than plasma concentrations obtained w ith the standard recommend ed TOPIRAMATE dose and dosage schedules.
