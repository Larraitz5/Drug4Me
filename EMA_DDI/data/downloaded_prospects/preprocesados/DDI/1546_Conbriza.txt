> In a 30-day study, bazedoxifene increased hormone-binding globulin concentrations, including corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and THYROXINE-binding globulin (TBG).
> Bazedoxifene undergoes metabolism by URIDINE diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) ENZYMES in the intestinal tract and liver (see section 5.2). The metabolism of bazedoxifene may be increased by concomitant use of substances known to induce UGTs, such as rifampicin, PHENOBARBITAL, CARBAMAZEPINE, and PHENYTOIN, potentially leading to decreased systemic concentrations of bazedoxifene.
