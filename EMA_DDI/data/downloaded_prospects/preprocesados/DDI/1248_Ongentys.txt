> Combination of opicapone and MAO INHIBITORS could result in inhibition of the majority of the pathways responsible for the metabolism of CATECHOLAMINES. Because of this, concomitant use of opicapone with MAO INHIBITORS (e.g. PHENELZINE, TRANYLCYPROMINE and MOCLOBEMIDE) other than those for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease is contraindicated  (see section 4.3) .  Concomitant use of opicapone and MAO inhib itors for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, e.g. RASAGILINE (up to 1 mg/day) and SELEGILINE (up to 10 mg/day in oral formulation or 1.25 mg/day in buccal absorption formulation), is permissible . 
> There is limited experience with opicapone when used concomitantly with tricyclic ANTIDEPRESSANTS and noradrenaline re -uptake inhibitors (e.g. venl afaxine, MAPROTILINE and DESIPRAMINE). Thus, their concomitant use should be considered with appropriate caution. 
> A study conducted in healthy volunteers showed that when a single dose of 50 mg opicapone was co-administered (within 1 hour) with  a single dose of QUINIDINE (600 mg), systemic exposure of  opicapone decreased by 37% (AUC
0-tlast). Thus, particular consideration should be given to cases where QUINIDINE needs to be administered together with opicapone  as their co -administration should  be avoided.
