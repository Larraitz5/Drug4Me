> No formal pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies have been conducted with pembrolizumab
. Sincepembrolizumab is cleared f rom the circulation through catabolism, no metabolic drug-druginteractions are expected. The use of systemic CORTICOSTEROIDS or IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS before starting pembrolizumab
 should beavoided because of their potential interf erence with the pharmacodynamic activity and eff icacy ofpembrolizumab
. However, systemic CORTICOSTEROIDS or OTHER IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS can be used af terstarting pembrolizumab
 to treat immune
-mediated  adverse reactions (see section
 4.4). Corticosteroidscan also be used as premedication, when pembrolizumab
 is used in combination with chemotherapy,as antiemetic prophylaxis and/or to alleviate chemotherapy
-related adverse reactions.
