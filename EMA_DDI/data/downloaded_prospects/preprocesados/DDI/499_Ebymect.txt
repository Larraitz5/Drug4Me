> This medicinal product may add to the diuretic effect of thiazide and LOOP DIURETICS and may increase the risk of dehy dration and hypotension (see section 4.4).Insulin and insulin secretagogues
> Insulin and insulin secretagogues, such as sulphonylureas, cause hypoglycaemia. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or an insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with DAPAGLIFLOZIN (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).Pharmacokinetic interactions
> Interaction studies conducted in healthy subjects, using mainly a single -dose design, suggest that the pharmacokinetics of DAPAGLIFLOZIN are not altered by PIOGLITAZONE, SITAGLIPTIN, GLIMEPIRIDE, VOGLIBOSE, hydroc hlorothiazide, BUMETANIDE, VALSARTAN, or SIMVASTATIN.Following coadministration of DAPAGLIFLOZIN with rifampicin (an inducer of VARIOUS active transporters and drug-metabolising ENZYMES) a 22 %decrease in DAPAGLIFLOZIN systemic exposure (AUC) was observe d, but with no clinically meaningful effect on 24 -hour urinary GLUCOSE excretion. No dose adjustment is recommended. A clinically relevant effect with other inducers (e.g. CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENYTOIN, PHENOBARBITAL) is not expected.Following coadministratio n of DAPAGLIFLOZIN with MEFENAMIC ACID (an inhibitor of UGT1A9), a 55 %increase in DAPAGLIFLOZIN systemic exposure was seen, but with no clinically meaningful effect on 24 -hour urinary GLUCOSE excretion. No dose adjustment is recommended.Effect of dapagl iflozin on other medicinal products
> In interaction studies conducted in healthy subjects, using mainly a single -dose design, DAPAGLIFLOZIN did not alter the pharmacokinetics of PIOGLITAZONE, SITAGLIPTIN, GLIMEPIRIDE, HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE, BUMETANIDE, valsar tan, DIGOXIN (a P -gp substrate) or WARFARIN (S -WARFARIN, a CYP2C9 substrate), or the anti -coagulatory effects of WARFARIN as measured by INR. Combination of a single dose of DAPAGLIFLOZIN 20 mg and SIMVASTATIN (a CYP3A4 substrate) resulted in a 19 %increas e in AUC of SIMVASTATIN and 31 %increase in AUC of SIMVASTATIN acid. The increase in SIMVASTATIN and SIMVASTATIN acid exposures are not considered clinically relevant .9Interference with 1,5 -anhydroglucitol (1,5 -AG) assay
> Cationic substances that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion (e.g. CIMETIDINE) may interact with METFORMIN by competing for common renal tubular transport systems. A study conducted in seven normal healthy volunteers showed that CIMETIDINE, administered as 400 mg twice daily, increased METFORMIN systemic exposure (AUC) by 50 %and C maxby 81 %. Therefore, close monitoring of glycaemic control, dose adjustment within the recomm ended posology and changes in diabetic treatment should be considered when cationic medicinal products that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion are coadministered.Alcohol
> Alcohol intoxication is associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis, particularly in the case of fasting, malnutrition or hepatic impairment due to the METFORMIN active substance of this medicinal product (see section 4.4). Consumption of alcohol and medicinal products containing alcohol should be avoided.Iodinated contr ast agents
> Intravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents may lead to contrast induced nephropathy, resulting in METFORMIN accumulation and increased risk of lactic acidosis . METFORMIN must be discontinued prior to, or at the time of the imaging procedure and not restarted until at least 48 hours after, provided that renal function has been re -evaluated and found to be stable (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).Combination requiring precautions for use
> GLUCOCORTICOIDS (given by systemic and local routes ), beta -2agonists, and DIURETICS have intrinsic hyperglycaemic activity. The patient should be informed and more frequent blood GLUCOSE monitoring perfomed, especially at the beginning of treatment with such medicinal products. If necessary, the dose of the GLUCOSE -lower ing medicinal product should be adjusted during therapy with the other medicinal product and on its discontinuation.Some medicinal products can adversely affect renal function which mayincrease the risk of lactic acidosis , e.g. NSAID s, including selective cyclo -oxygenase (COX) II inhibitors, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and DIURETICS, especially LOOP DIURETICS. When starting or using such products in combination with METFORMIN, close monitoring of renal function is necessary.Insulin and insulin secretagogues
> Insulin and insulin secretagogues, such as sulphonylureas, cause hypoglycaemia. Therefore ,a lower dose of insulin or an insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with METFORMIN (see sections 4.2 and 4.8) .10
