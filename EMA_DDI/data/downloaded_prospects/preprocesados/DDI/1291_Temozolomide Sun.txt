> Administration of TMZ with fo od resulted in a 33 % decrease in C max and a 9 % decrease in area under  the curve (AUC).  As it cannot be excluded that the change in C max is clinically significant, TEMOZOLOMIDE SUN should be administered without food.
> Based on an analysis of population pharmacokinetics in phase II trials, co -administration of DEXAMETHASONE, PROCHLORPERAZINE, PHENYTOIN, CARBAMAZEPINE, ONDANSETRON, H 2 receptor antagonists, or  PHENOBARBITAL did not alter the clearance of TMZ. Co- administration with VALPROIC ACID was associated  with a small but statistically significant decrease in clearance of TMZ.
