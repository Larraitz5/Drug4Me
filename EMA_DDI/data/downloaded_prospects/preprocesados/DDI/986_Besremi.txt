> Interaction studies of  other pegylated interferon alfa medicinal products  7 Co-administration of pegylated interferon al fa-2a with TELBIVUDINE in patients with hepatitis B increased the risk of developing peripheral neuropathy. A combination therapy with TELBIVUDINE  and ropeginterferon alfa -2b is contraindicated ( see section 4.3) . 
> Administration of 180 micrograms of pegylated interferon alfa -2a once weekly for 4 weeks in healthy male subjects did not show any effect on MEPHENYTOIN, DAPSONE, DEBRISOQUINE and TOLBUTAMIDE pharmacokinetics profiles, suggesting that pegylated interferon alfa -2a has no effect on in vivo  metabolic activity of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, 2C9, 2C19 and 2D6 isozymes. In the same study, a 25% increase in the AUC of THEOPHYLLINE (CYP1A2 substrate) was observed, demonstrating that pegylated interferon alfa -2a is an inhibitor of CYP1A2 activity. 
> Co-administration of pegylated interferon al fa-2b showed no significant interaction with TOLBUTAMIDE (CYP2C9  substrate), MIDAZOLAM (CYP3A4 substrate), DAPSONE (N-acetyltransferase substrate) and modestly increased the exposure of CAFFEINE (CYP1A2 substrate) and DESIPRAMINE (CYP2D6 substrate). 
> Therefore, care should be taken when ropeginterferon alfa -2b is co-administered with CYP1A2 substrates notably those having a narrow therapeutic margin such as THEOPHYLLINE or METHADONE. Likewise, caution is recommended with CYP2D6 substrates ( e.g., VORTIOXETINE, RISPERIDONE) combined with ropeginterferon alfa -2b. Ropeginterferon alfa -2b may inhibit the activity of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6  and thus may increase the blood concentrations of these medicinal products.
