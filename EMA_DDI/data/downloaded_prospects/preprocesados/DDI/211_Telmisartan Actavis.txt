> DIGOXIN  When telmisartan was co -administered with DIGOXIN, median increases in DIGOXIN peak plasma concentration (49%) and in trough concentration (20%) were observed. When initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing telmisartan, monitor DIGOXIN levels in order to ma intain levels within the therapeutic range .
> As with other m edicinal products acting on the renin- angiotensin- aldosterone system, telmisartan  may provoke hyperkalaemia  (see section 4.4). The risk may increase in case of treatment combination with other med icinal products that may also provoke hyperkalaemia  (salt substitutes containing POTASSIUM, POTASSIUM -sparing DIURETICS, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, non steroidal anti -inflammatory medicinal products  (NSAIDs, including selective CO X-2 inhibitors), HEPARIN, immunosuppress ives (cyclosporin or TACROLIMUS), and TRIMETHOPRIM ).
> The occurrence of hyperkalaemia depends on associated risk factors. The risk is increased in case of the above -mentioned treatment combinations. The risk is parti cularly high in combination with POTASSIUM sparing -DIURETICS and when combined with salt substitutes containing POTASSIUM . A combination with ACE inhibitors or NSAIDs , for example, presents a lesser risk provided that precautions for use are strictly followed. 6  Concomitant use not recommended 
> POTASSIUM sparing DIURETICS or POTASSIUM supplements  Angiotensin II receptor antagonists such as telmisartan  attenuate diuretic induced POTASSIUM loss. POTASSIUM sparing DIURETICS e.g. spirinolactone , EPLERENONE, TRIAMTERENE, or AMILORIDE, POTASSIUM supplements, or POTASSIUM -containing salt substitutes may lead to a significant increase in serum POTASSIUM. If concomitant use is indicated because of documented hypokalaemia , they should be used with cau tion and with frequent monitoring of serum POTASSIUM.
> LITHIUM  Reversible increases in serum LITHIUM concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of LITHIUM with angiotensin converting ENZYME INHIBITORS , and with angiote nsin II receptor antagonists , including telmisartan . If use of the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum LITHIUM levels is recommended. 
> In one study the co- administration of telmisartan and RAMIPRIL led to an increase of up to 2. 5 fold in the AUC 0-24 and C max of RAMIPRIL and ramiprilat. The clinical relevance of this observation is not known. 
> Clinical trial data has shown that dual blockade o f the renin- angiotensin- aldosterone -system (RAAS) through the combined use of ACE -inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or ALISKIREN is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events such as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal funct ion (including acute renal failure) compared to the use of a single RAAS -acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1).
