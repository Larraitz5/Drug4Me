> Steady -state co -administration of ambrisentan and CYCLOSPORINE A resulted in a 2 -fold increase in ambrisentan exposure in healthy volunteers. This may be due to the inhibition by CYCLOSPORINE A of transporters and metabolic ENZYMES involved in the pharmacokinetics of ambrisentan. Therefore the dose of ambrisentan should be limited to 5 mg once daily when co -administered with cyclosporin e A (see section  4.2). Multiple doses of ambrisentan had no effect on CYCLOSPORINE A exposure, and no dose adjustment of cy closporine A is warranted. 
> Co-administration of rifampicin (an inhibitor of Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide [OATP], a strong inducer of CYP3A and 2C19, and inducer of P- gp and URIDINE -diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases [UGTs]) was associated with a transient (approximately 2-fold) increase in ambrisentan exposure following initial doses in healthy volunteers. However, by day 8 , steady state administration of rifampicin had no clinically relevant effect on ambrisentan exposure. Patients on ambrisentan therapy should be closely monitored when starting treatment with rifampicin (see sections 4 .4 and 5.2). 
> Co-administration of ambrisentan with a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, either SILDENAFIL or TADALAFIL (both substrates of CYP3A4) in healthy volunteers did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor or ambrisentan (see section  5.2).
> Steady -state administration of KETOCONAZOLE (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) did not result in a clinically significant increase in exposure to ambrisentan (see section  5.2).
