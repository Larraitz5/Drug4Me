- Enzyme inducer s   Co-administration of pitolisant with rifampicin in multiple doses significantly decreases pitolisant mean C max and AUC ratio about 39% and 50%, respectively. Therefore, co- administration of pitolisant with potent CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, PHENOBARBITAL, CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENYTOIN) should be done with caution. With St John’s Wort (Hypericum Perforatum), due t o its strong CYP3A4 inducing effect, caution should be exercised when taken concurrently with pitolisant. A clinical monitoring should be made whe n both active substances are combined and, eventually a dosage adjustment during the combination and one week after the inducer treatment.   In a clinical multiple dose study, the combination of pitolisant with PROBENECID decrease s the AUC of pitolisant by about 34%.

- CYP2D6 inhibitors   Co-administration of pitolisant with PAROXETINE significantly increases pitolisant mean C max and AUC 0—72h ratio about 47% and 105%, respectively. Given the 2- fold increase of pitolisant exposure, its coadministration with CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g. PAROXETINE, FLUOXETINE, VENLAFAXINE, DULOXETINE, BUPROPION, QUINIDINE, TERBINAFINE, CINACALCET) should be done with caution. A dosage adjustment during the combination could eventually be considered.

- CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 substrates  Based on in vitro  data, pitolisant  and its main metabolites may induce CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 at therapeutic concentrations and by extrapolation, CYP2C, UGTs and P -gp. No clinical data on the magnitude of this interaction are available. Therefore, the combination of pitolisant with substrates o f CYP3A4 and having a narrow therapeutic margin (e.g. IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS, DOCETAXEL, kinase 6   inhibitors, CISAPRIDE, PIMOZIDE, HALOFANTRINE) should be avoided (see section 4.4). With other CYP3A4, CYP2B6 (e.g. EFAVIRENZ, BUPROPION), CYP2C (e.g. REPAGLINIDE, PHENYTOIN, WARFARIN), P -gp (e.g. DABIGATRAN, DIGOXIN) and UGT (e.g. MORPHINE, paracetamol, IRINOTECAN) substrates , caution should be made with a clinical monitoring of their efficacy.  
>   The combination of pitolisant with MODAFINIL or SODIUM OXYBATE, usual treatments of narcolepsy was evaluated in healthy volunteers, at therapeutic doses. No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic drug -drug interaction was evidenced either with MODAFINIL or wi th SODIUM OXYBATE.
