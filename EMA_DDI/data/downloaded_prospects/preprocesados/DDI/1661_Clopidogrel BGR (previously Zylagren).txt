> Medicinal products associated with bleeding risk : There is an increased risk of bleeding due to the potential additive effect. The concomitant administration of medicinal products associated with bleeding risk should be undertaken with caution (see section 4.4).Oral anticoagulants: the concomitant administration of CLOPIDOGREL with oral anticoagulants is not recommended since it may increase the intensity of bleedings (see section 4.4). Although the administration of CLOPIDOGREL 75 mg/day did not modify the pharmacokinetics of S -WARFARIN or International Normalised Ratio (INR) in patients receiving long -term WARFARIN therapy, coadministration of CLOPIDOGREL with WARFARIN increases the risk of bleeding because of independent effects on hemostasis.Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors: CLOPIDOGREL should be used with caution in patients who receive concomitant glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (see section 4.4).Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) :ASA did not modify the CLOPIDOGREL -mediated inhibition of ADP -induced platelet aggregation, but clopid ogrel potentiated the effect of ASA on collagen -induced platelet aggregation. However, concomitant administration of 500 mg of ASA twice a day for one day did not significantly increase the prolongation of bleeding time induced by CLOPIDOGREL intake. A pharmacodynamic interaction between CLOPIDOGREL and acetylsalicylic acid is possible, leading to increased risk of bleeding. Therefore, concomitant use should be undertaken with caution (see section 4.4). However, CLOPIDOGREL and ASA have been administered to gether for up to one year (see section 5.1).HEPARIN : in a clinical study conducted in healthy subjects, CLOPIDOGREL did not necessitate modification of the HEPARIN dose or alter the effect of HEPARIN on coagulation. Co -administration of HEPARIN had no effect on the inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by CLOPIDOGREL. A pharmacodynamic interaction between CLOPIDOGREL and HEPARIN is possible, leading to increased risk of bleeding. Ther efore, concomitant use should be undertaken with caution (see secti on 4.4).Thrombolytics : the safety of the concomitant administration of CLOPIDOGREL, fibrin or non -fibrin specific thrombolytic agents and heparins was assessed in patients with acute myocardial infarction. The incidence of clinically significant bleeding was similar to that observed when thrombolytic agents and HEPARIN are co -administered with ASA (see section 4.8).NSAIDs :in a clinical study conducted in healthy volunteers, the concomitant administration of CLOPIDOGREL and NAPROXEN increased occult gas trointestinal blood loss. However, due to the lack of interaction studies with other NSAIDs it is presently unclear whether there is an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding with all NSAIDs. Consequently, NSAIDs including Cox -2 inhibitors and clopido grel should be co -administered with caution (see section 4.4).SSRIs : since SSRIs affect platelet activation and increase the risk of bleeding, the concomitant administration of SSRIs with CLOPIDOGREL should be undertaken with caution.Other concomitant therapy : Since CLOPIDOGREL is metabolised to its active metabolite partly by CYP2C19, use of medicinal products that inhibit the activity of this enzyme would be expected to result in reduced drug levels of the active metabolite of CLOPIDOGREL. The clinica l relevance of this 6interaction is uncertain. As a precaution c oncomitant use of strong or moderate CYP2C19 inhibitors should be discouraged (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).Medicinal products that are strong or moderate CYP2C19 inhibitors include, for example , OMEPRAZOLE and ESOMEPRAZOLE, FLUVOXAMINE, FLUOXETINE, MOCLOBEMIDE, VORICONAZOLE, FLUCONAZOLE, TICLOPIDINE, CARBAMAZEPINE, and EFAVIRENZ.PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS (PPI): OMEPRAZOLE 80 mg once daily administered either at the same time as CLOPIDOGREL or wi th 12 hours between the administrations of the two drugs decreased the exposure of the active metabolite by 45% (loading dose ) and 40% ( maintenance dose). The decrease was associated with a 39% (loading dose) and 21% (maintenance dose) reduction of inhibit ion of platelet aggregation. ESOMEPRAZOLE is expected to give a similar interaction with CLOPIDOGREL.Inconsistent data on the clinical implications of this pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) interaction in terms of major cardiovascular events have been reported from both observational and clinical studies. As a precaution, concomitant use of OMEPRAZOLE or ESOMEPRAZOLE should be discouraged (see section 4.4). Less pronounced reductions of metabolite exposure has been observed with PANTOPRAZOLE or LANSOPRAZOLE.The plasma concentrations of the active metabolite was 20% reduced (loading dose) and 14% reduced (maintenance dose) during concomitant treatment with PANTOPRAZOLE 80 mg once daily. This was associated with a reduction of the mean inhibition of platelet aggregation by 15% and 11%, respectively. These results indicate that CLOPIDOGREL can be administered with PANTOPRAZOLE .Ther e is no evidence that other medicinal products that reduce stomach acid such as H2 blockers  or ANTACIDS interfere wit h antiplatelet activity of CLOPIDOGREL.Boosted anti -retroviral therapy (ART): HIV patients treated with boosted anti -retroviral therapies (ART) are at high risk of vascular events.A significantly reduced platelet inhibition has been shown in HIV patien ts treated with RITONAVIR -or COBICISTAT -boosted ART. Although the clinical relevance of these findings is uncertain, there have been spontaneous reports of HIV -infected patients treated with RITONAVIR boosted ART, who have experienced re -occlusive events a fter de -obstruction or have suffered thrombotic events under a CLOPIDOGREL loading treatment schedule. Average platelet inhibition can be decreased with concomitant use of CLOPIDOGREL and RITONAVIR. Therefore, concomitant use of CLOPIDOGREL with ART booste d therapies should be discouraged.Other medicinal products:A number of other clinical studies have been conducted with CLOPIDOGREL and other concomitant medicinal products to investigate the potential for pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions . No clinically significant pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when CLOPIDOGREL was co -administered with ATENOLOL, NIFEDIPINE, or both ATENOLOL and NIFEDIPINE. Furthermore, the pharmacodynamic activity of CLOPIDOGREL was not significantly influence d by the coadministration of PHENOBARBITAL or oestrogen.The pharmacokinetics of DIGOXIN or THEOPHYLLINE were not modified by the co -administration of CLOPIDOGREL. ANTACIDS did not modify the extent of CLOPIDOGREL absorption.Data from the CAPRIE study i ndicate that PHENYTOIN and TOLBUTAMIDE which are metabolised by CYP2C9 can be safely co -administered with CLOPIDOGREL.CYP2C8 substrate medicinal products: CLOPIDOGREL has been shown to increase REPAGLINIDE exposure in healthy volunteers. In vitro studies have shown the increase in REPAGLINIDE exposure is due to 7inhibition of CYP2C8 by the glucuronide metabolite of CLOPIDOGREL. Due to the risk of increased plasma concentrations, concomitant administration of CLOPIDOGREL and drugs primarily cleared by CYP2C 8 metabolism (e.g., REPAGLINIDE, PACLITAXEL) should be undertaken with caution (see section 4.4).Apart from the specific medicinal product interaction information described above, interaction studies with CLOPIDOGREL and some medicinal products commonly administered in patients with atherothrombotic disease have not been performed. However, patients entered into clinical trials with CLOPIDOGREL received a variety of concomitant medicinal products including DIURETICS, beta blockers, ACEI, CALCIUM antagonis ts, cholesterol lowering agents, coronary vasodilators, antidiabetic agents (including insulin), antiepileptic agents, and GPIIb/IIIa antagonists without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions.As with other oral P2Y12 inhibitors, co -admi nistration of opioid agonists has the potential to delay and reduce the absorption of CLOPIDOGREL presumably because of slowed gastric emptying. The clinical relevance is unknown. Consider the use of a parenteral antiplatelet agent in acute coronary syndro me patients requiring co -administration of MORPHINE or other opioid agonists.
