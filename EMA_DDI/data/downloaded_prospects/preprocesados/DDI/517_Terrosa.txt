> In a study of 15 healthy subjects administered DIGOXIN daily to steady state, a single teriparatide dose did not alter the cardiac effect of DIGOXIN. However, sporadic case reports have suggested that hypercalcaemia may predispose patients to digitalis toxicity. Because teriparatide transiently increases serum CALCIUM, teriparatide should be used with caution in patients takin g digitalis. 
> Co-administration of RALOXIFENE or hormone replacement therapy with teriparatide did not alte r the effects of teriparatide on serum or urine CALCIUM or on clinical adverse events.
