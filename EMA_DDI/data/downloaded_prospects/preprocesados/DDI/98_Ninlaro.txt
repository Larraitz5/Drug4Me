> Co-administration of ixazomib with CLARITHROMYCIN, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, did not result in a clinically meaningful change in the systemic exposure of ixazomib. Ixazomib Cmax was decreased by 
4% and AUC was increased by 11%. Therefore, no dose modification is required for ixazomib with co-administration of strong CYP3A inhibitors.
