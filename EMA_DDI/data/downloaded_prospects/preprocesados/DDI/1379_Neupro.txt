> Because rotigotine is a DOPAMINE agonist, it is assumed that DOPAMINE antagonists, such as neuroleptics (e.g. phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or METOCLOPRAMIDE, may diminish the effectiveness of NEUPRO, and co- administration should be avoided. Because of possible additive effects, caution should be advised when patients are taking sedating medicinal products or other CNS (CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM) depressants (e.g. benzodiazepines, ANTIPSYCHOTICS, ANTIDEPRESSANTS) or alcohol in combination with rotigotine. 
> 6 Co-administration of L -dopa and CARBIDOPA with rotigotine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of rotigotine, and rotigotine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of L-dopa and CARBIDOPA.
> Co-administration of DOMPERIDONE with rotigotine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of rotigotine. 
> Co-administration of OMEPRAZOLE (inhibitor of CYP2C19), in doses of 40 mg/day, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of rotigotine in healthy volunteers.
> Co-administration of rotigotine (3  mg/24  h) did not affect the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives (0.03 mg ethinylestradiol, 0.15  mg LEVONORGESTREL).  Interactions with other forms of hormonal contraception have not been investigated.
