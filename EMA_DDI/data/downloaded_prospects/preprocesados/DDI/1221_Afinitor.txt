> P inhibitor, dose reduction to 5  mg daily or 2.5 mg daily  may be considered. However, there are no clinical data with this dose adjustment. Due to between subject variability the recommended dose adjustments may not be optimal in all individuals, therefore close monitoring of side effects is recommended  (see sec tions  4.2 and 
4.4). If the moderate inhibitor is discontinued, consider a washout period of at least 2 to 3  days (average elimination time for most commonly used moderate inhibitors) before the AFINITOR dose is returned to the dose used prior to initiation  of the co -administration.

> Potent  and moderate  CYP3A4 inducers  Rifampicin  AUC ↓63%  (range 0 -80%)  Cmax ↓58%  (range 10 -70%)  Avoid the use of concomitant potent CYP3A4 inducers. If patients require co -administration of a potent CYP3A4 inducer, an AFINITOR dose increase from 10  mg daily up to 20  mg daily should be considered using 5  mg increments or less applied on Day 4 and 8 following start of the inducer. This dose of AFINITOR is predicted to adjust the AUC to the range observed without inducers. However, there are no clinical data with this dose adjustment. If treatment with the inducer is discontinued, consider a washout period of at least 3 to 5  days (reasonable time for significant enzyme de -induction), before  the AFINITOR dose is returned to the dose used prior to initiation of the co-administration.  DEXAMETHASONE  Not studied. Decreased exposure expected.  CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENOBARBITAL, PHENYTOIN  Not studied. Decreased exposure expected.  EFAVIRENZ, NEVIRAPINE  Not studied. Decreased exposure expected.  St John’s Wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) Not studied. Large decrease in exposure expected.  Preparations containing St John’s Wort should not be used during treatment with everolimus 
> P in the gut cannot be excluded. An interaction study in healthy subjects demonstrated th at co -administration of an oral dose of MIDAZOLAM, a sensitive CYP3A substrate probe, with everolimus resulted in a 25% increase in MIDAZOLAM C max and a 30% increase in MIDAZOLAM AUC (0-inf). The effect is likely to be due to inhibition of intestinal CYP3A4  by everolimus. Hence everolimus may affect the bioavailability of orally co -administered CYP3A4 substrates. However, a clinically relevant effect on the exposure of systemically administered CYP3A4 substrates is not expected (see section  4.4).
> Co-adminis tration of everolimus and depot OCTREOTIDE increased OCTREOTIDE C min with a geometric mean ratio (everolimus/placebo) of 1.47. A clinically significant effect on the efficacy response to everolimus in patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumours could not  be established. 
> Co-administration of everolimus and EXEMESTANE increased EXEMESTANE C min and C 2h by 45% and 64%, respectively. However, the corresponding oestradiol levels at steady state (4  weeks) were not different between the two treatment arms. No in crease in adverse reactions related to EXEMESTANE was observed in patients with hormone receptor -positive advanced breast cancer receiving the combination. The increase in EXEMESTANE levels is unlikely to have an impact on efficacy or safety. 
> Patients taking concomitant ACE INHIBITOR (e.g. RAMIPRIL) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema (see section  4.4).
