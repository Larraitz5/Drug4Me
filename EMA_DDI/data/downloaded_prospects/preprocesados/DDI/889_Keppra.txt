> As in adults, there is no evidence of clinically significant medicinal product interactions in paediatric patients receiving up to 60  mg/kg/day levetiracetam.  A retrospective assessment of pharmacokinetic interactions in children and adolescents with epilepsy (4 to 17 years) confirmed that adjunctive therapy with orally administered levetiracetam did not influence the steady -state serum  concentrations of concomitantly administered CARBAMAZEPINE and valproate. However, data suggested a 20 % higher levetiracetam clearance in children taking  enzyme-inducing antiepileptic medicinal products. Dose adjustment is not required.  7  PROBENECID  PROBENECID (500  mg four times daily), a renal tubular secretion blocking agent, has been shown to inhibit the renal clearance of the primary metabolite, but not of levetiracetam. Nevertheless, the concentration of this metabolite remains low. 
> METHOTREXATE  Concomitant administration of levetiracetam and METHOTREXATE has been reported to decrease METHOTREXATE clearance, resulting in increased/prolonged blood METHOTREXATE concentration to potentially toxic levels. Blood METHOTREXATE and levetiracetam levels sho uld be carefully monitored in patients treated concomitantly with the two drugs. 
> LAXATIVES  There have been isolated reports of decreased levetiracetam efficacy when the osmotic laxative macrogol has been concomitantly administered with oral  levetiracetam. Therefore, macrogol should not be taken orally for one hour before and for one hour after taking levetiracetam.
