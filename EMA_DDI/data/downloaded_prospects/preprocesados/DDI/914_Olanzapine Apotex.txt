> Induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking and carb amazepine, which may lead to reduced olanzapine concentra tions. Only slight to moderate i ncrease in olanzapine clearance has been observed. The clinical consequences are likely to be l imited, but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase of o lanzapine dose may be considere d if necessary (see section 4.2).  Inhibition of CYP1A2 FLUVOXAMINE, a specific CYP1A2 i nhibitor, has been shown to sig nificantly inhibit the metabolism of olanzapine. The mean increase in olanzapine C max following FLUVOXAMINE was 54 
% in female non-smokers and 77 % in male smokers. The mean incr ease in olanzapine AUC was 52 % and 108 % respectively. A lower starting dose of olanz apine should be considered in patients who are using fluvoxamin e or any other CYP1A2 inhibito rs, such as CIPROFLOXACIN. A decrease in the dose of olanzapine should be considered if trea tment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated.  Decreased bioavailability Activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral olanzapi ne by 50 to 60% and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after olanzapine.
