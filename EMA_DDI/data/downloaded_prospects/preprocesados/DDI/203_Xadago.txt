> Serious adverse reactions have been reported with the concomitant use of pethidine and MAO INHIBITORS. As this may be a class-effect, the concomitant administration of safinamide and pethidine is contraindicated (see section 4.3).
> There have been reports of medicinal product interactions with the concomitant use of MAO INHIBITORS and sympathomimetic medicinal products. In view of the MAO inhibitory activity of safinamide, concomitant administration of safinamide and SYMPATHOMIMETICS, such as those present in nasal and oral decongestants or cold medicinal products containing EPHEDRINE or PSEUDOEPHEDRINE, requires caution (see section 4.4).
> DEXTROMETHORPHAN There have been reports of medicinal product interactions with the concomitant use of DEXTROMETHORPHAN and non-selective MAO INHIBITORS. In view of the MAO inhibitory activity of safinamide, the concomitant administration of safinamide and DEXTROMETHORPHAN is not recommended, or if concomitant treatment is necessary, it should be used with caution (see section 4.4).
> ANTIDEPRESSANTS   The concomitant use of safinamide and FLUOXETINE or FLUVOXAMINE should be avoided (see section 4.4), this precaution is based on the occurrence of serious adverse reactions (e.g. serotonin syndrome), although rare, that have occurred when SSRIs and DEXTROMETHORPHAN have been used with MAO INHIBITORS. If necessary, the concomitant use of these medicinal products should be at the lowest effective dose. A washout period corresponding to 5 half-lives of the SSRI used previously should be considered prior to initiating treatment with safinamide.
> 5 Serious adverse reactions have been reported with the concomitant use of SELECTIVE SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INHIBITORS (SSRIs), serotonin NOREPINEPHRINE reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic/tetracyclic ANTIDEPRESSANTS and MAO INHIBITORS (see section 4.4). In view of the selective and reversible MAO-B inhibitory activity of safinamide, ANTIDEPRESSANTS may be administered but used at the lowest doses necessary.
> Safinamide may transiently inhibit BCRP in vitro . In drug-drug-interaction studies in human, a weak interaction was observed with ROSUVASTATIN (AUC increase between 1.25 and 2.00 fold) but no significant interaction was found with DICLOFENAC.  It is recommended to monitor patients when safinamide is taken with medicinal products that are BCRP substrates (e.g., ROSUVASTATIN, PITAVASTATIN, PRAVASTATIN, CIPROFLOXACIN, METHOTREXATE, TOPOTECAN, DICLOFENAC or GLYBURIDE) and to refer to their Sm
> Safinamide inhibits OCT1  in vitro  at clinically relevant portal vein concentrations. Therefore, caution is necessary when safinamide is taken concomitantly with medicinal products that are OCT1 substrates and have a t max similar to safinamide (2 hours) (e.g. METFORMIN, aciclovir, GANCICLOVIR) as exposure to these substrates might be increased as a consequence.
