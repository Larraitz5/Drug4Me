> L, respectively. Co-administration ofcef tolozane/TAZOBACTAM with OAT1 and OAT3 substrate f urosemide in a clinical study did notsignif icantly increase f urosemide plasma exposures (geometric mean ratios of  0.83 and
 0.87 f or C maxand AUC, respectively)
. However, active substances that inhibit OAT1 or OAT3 (e.g., PROBENECID)may increase TAZOBACTAM plasma concentrations.7
