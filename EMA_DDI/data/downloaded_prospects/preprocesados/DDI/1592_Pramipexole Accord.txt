> PRAMIPEXOLE is bound to plasma proteins to a very low (< 20%) extent, and little biotransformation is seen in man. Therefore, interactions with other medicinal products affecting plasma protein binding or elimination by biotransformation are unlikely. As ANTICHOLINERGICS are mainly eliminated by biotransformation, the potent ial for an interaction is limited, although an interaction with ANTICHOLINERGICS has not been investigated. There is no pharmacokinetic interaction with SELEGILINE and LEVODOPA.  Inhibitors/competitors of active renal elimination pathway 
> Combination with LEVODOPA 
> When PRAMIPEXOLE ACCORD is given in combination with LEVODOPA, it is recommended that the dose of LEVODOPA is reduced and the dose of other anti-parkinsonian medicinal products is kept constant while increasing the dose of PRAMIPEXOLE ACCORD. 
> Co-administration of antipsychotic medicinal products with PRAMIPEXOLE should be avoided (see section 4.4), e.g. if antagonistic effects can be expected.
