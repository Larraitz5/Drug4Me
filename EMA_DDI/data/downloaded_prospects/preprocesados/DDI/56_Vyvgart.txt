> All VACCINES should be administered according to immunisation guidelines.  The potential interaction with VACCINES was studied in a nonclinical model using Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) as the antigen. The weekly administration of 100  mg/kg to monkeys did not impact the immune response to KLH immunisation.  For patients that are being treated with EFGARTIGIMOD ALFA, vaccination with live or live -attenuated VACCINES is generally not recommended. If vaccination with live or live -attenuated VACCINES is required, these VACCINES should be administered at least 4  weeks before treatment and at least 2  weeks after the last dose of a treatment cycle EFGARTIGIMOD ALFA (see section  4.4).
