Caution should be exercised when EXTAVIA is administered in combination with medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic cytochrome P450 system for clear ance, e.g. anti -epileptics. Additional caution should be exercised with any co -medication which has an effect on the haematopoetic system.
