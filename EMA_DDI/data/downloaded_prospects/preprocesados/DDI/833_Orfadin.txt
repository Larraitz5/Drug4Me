> Based on data from a clinical interaction study with 80  mg nitisinone at steady- state, nitisinone is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C9 (2.3- fold increase in TOLBUTAMIDE AUC) , therefore nitisinone treatment may result in increased plasma concentrations of co- administered medicinal products metabolized primarily via CYP2C9 (see section  4.4).  Nitisinone is a weak inducer of CYP2E1 (30% decreas e in CHLORZOXAZONE AUC) and a weak inhibitor of OAT1 and OAT3  (1.7- fold increase in AUC of FUROSEMIDE) , whereas nitisin one did not inhibit CYP2D6 (see section  5.2).
