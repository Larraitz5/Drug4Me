> CYP3A4 /P-gp inducers  A clinical study demonstrated that concomitant use  of strong CYP3A4/P -gp inducers significantly decreased neratinib exposure, therefore concurrent use of neratinib with strong CYP3A4/P -gp inducers is contraindicated (e.g. strong inducers: PHENYTOIN, CARBAMAZEPINE, rifampic in, or herbal preparations containing St Johnâ€™s Wort  (Hypericum perforatum) ). Concurrent use of neratinib with moderate CYP3A4/P -gp inducers  is not recommended as it may also lead to loss of efficacy (e.g. moderate inducers: BOSENTAN, EFAVIRENZ, ETRAVIRINE , PHENOBARBITAL, PRIMIDONE, DEXAMETHASONE)  (see section s 4.3 and 5.2 ).

> CYP3A4 /P-gp inhibitors  A clinical study and model -based predictions have demon strated that concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A4/P -gp inhibitors significantly  increased neratinib systemic exposure, therefore, concomitant use of neratinib with strong and moderate CYP3A4 /P-gp inhibitors is not recommended  (e.g. strong inhibitors: ATAZANAVIR, INDINAVIR, NEFAZODONE, NELFINAVIR, RITONAVIR, SAQUINAVIR, LOPINAVIR, ket oconazole, ITRACONAZOLE, CLARITHROMYCIN, TROLEANDOMYCIN, VORICONAZOLE, and COBICISTAT; moderate inhibitors: CIPROFLOXACIN,   cyclosporin, DILTIAZEM, FLUCONAZOLE, ERYTHROMYCIN, FLUVOXAMINE and VERAPAMIL) .  If the inhibitor can not be avoided, NERLYNX dose adjustment shoud be applied (see s ection s 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2) .
> Grapefruit /pomegranate  or grapefruit /pomegranate  juice may also increase neratinib plasma concentrations and should be avoided (see s ection 4.2 and 4.4) . PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS , H
2-receptor antagonists and ANTACIDS  The in -vitro  solubility of neratinib is p
> H may lower the absorption of neratinib, thus decreasing systemic exposure. Co -8 administration with PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS (PPIS)  is not recommended  (e.g. OMEPRAZOLE or LANSOPRAZOLE) (see sections  4.4 and 5.2). 
> Antidiarr hoeal LOPERAMIDE  A clinical study has  demon strated that there were no clinically  significant differences in the exposure of subjects to neratinib with or without concurrent dosing with LOPERAMIDE  (see section 
5.2). 
> P-glycoprotein efflux trans porters  In-vitro  studies  demonstrated that  neratinib is an inhibitor of P -glycoprotein (P -gp) efflux transporters. This has been confirmed by a clinical study using DIGOXIN as probe substrate leading to an increase of 54 and 32% in Cmax and AUC, respectively . This might be clinically relevant for patients who are treated concomitantly with therapeutic agents with a narrow therapeutic window whose absorption involves P -gp transporters in the gastrointestinal tract (e.g. DIGOXIN, COLCHICINE, DABIGATRAN, PHENYTOIN, statins, CYCLOSPORINE, EVEROLIMUS, SIROLIMUS, TACROLIMUS) . They should be carefully monitored (see s ection s 4.4 and 5.2) .
> Breast cancer resistance protein efflux transporter  Neratinib may inhibit breast cancer resistance protein  (BCRP ) at intestinal level as suggested by in vitro studies. A c linical stud y with BCRP substrates has  not been conducted. As co -administration of neratinib with BCRP substrates may lead to an increase of their exposure, patients who are treated with BCRP substrates (e.g., ROSUVASTATIN, SULFASALAZINE and IRINOTECAN ) should be monitored carefully (see section  5.2).
