> AERINAZE  The following combinations are not recommended: 
• digitalis (see section  4.4) 
• BROMOCRIPTINE 
• CABERGOLINE 
• LISURIDE, PERGOLIDE: risk of vasoconstriction and increase in blood pressure.
> No interaction studies have been performed with the combination of DESLORATADINE and PSEUDOEPHEDRINE sulphat e.
> 5 The interaction with AERINAZE and alcohol has not been studied. However, in a clinical pharmacology trial DESLORATADINE taken concomitantly with alcohol did not potentiate the performance impairing effects of alcohol. No significant differences were found in the psychomotor test results between DESLORATADINE and placebo groups, whether administered alone or with alcohol. Alcohol use should be avoided during AERINAZE treatment. 
> PSEUDOEPHEDRINE sulphate ANTACIDS increase the rate of PSEUDOEPHEDRINE sulphate absorption, KAOLIN decreases it.  SYMPATHOMIMETICS  Reversible and irreversible MAO inhibitor(s) may cause: risk of vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure. 
> Concurrent administration with other sympathomimetic s (decongestants, anorexogenics or AMPHETAMINE -type psychostimulants, antihypertensive medicinal products, tricyclic ANTIDEPRESSANTS and other antihistamines
) may result in critical hypertension reactions (see section  4.4).
> DIHYDROERGOTAMINE, ERGOTAMINE, methylergometrine: risk of vasoconstriction and increase in blood pressure.
