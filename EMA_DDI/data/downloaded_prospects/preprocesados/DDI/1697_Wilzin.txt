> Other anti -COPPER agents  Pharmacodynamic studies were conducted in Wilsonâ€™s disease patients on the combination of  WILZIN  (50 mg three  times daily ) with ascorbic acid (1  g once daily), PENICILLAMINE (250 mg four times daily), and trientine ( 250 mg four times daily).  They showed no significant overall effect on COPPER balance although mild interaction of zinc with chelators (PENICILLAMINE and trientine) could be detected  with decrease d faecal but increased urinary COPPER excretion as compared with zinc alone. This is probably due to some extent of complexion of zinc by the chelator, thus reducing the effect of both active substance s. When switching a patient on chelating treatment to W ilzin for maintenance therapy , the chelating treatment should be maintained and co -administered for  2 to 3 weeks since this is the time it takes for the zinc treatment to induce  maximum metallothionein induction and full blockade of COPPER absorption. The administration of the chelating treatment and WILZIN should be separated by at least 
1 hour.
