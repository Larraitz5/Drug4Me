> Renally eliminated medicinal products  Since EMTRICITABINE and TENOFOVIR are primarily eliminated by the kidneys, co- admini stration of EMTRICITABINE/TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL ZENTIVA  with medicinal products that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion (e.g. CIDOFOVIR) may increase serum concentrations of EMTRICITABINE, TENOFOVIR and/or the co- administered medicinal products.  Use of EMTRICITABINE/TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL ZENTIVA  should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic medicinal product. Some examples include, but are not limited to, aminoglycosides, AMPHOTERICIN B, FOSCARNET, GANCICLOVIR, pe ntamidine, VANCOMYCIN, CIDOFOVIR or interleukin- 2 (see section 4.4).

> Increased systemic exposure to DIDANOSINE may increase DIDANOSINE related adverse reactions. Rarely, pancreatitis and lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, have been reported. Co -administration of TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL and DIDANOSINE at a dose of 400 mg daily has been associated with a significant decrease in CD4 cell count, possibly due to an intracellular interaction increasing phos phorylated (i.e. active) DIDANOSINE. A decreased dosage of 
250 mg DIDANOSINE co -administered with TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL therapy has been associated with reports of high rates of virological failure within several tested combinations for the treatment of HIV- 1 infection.
