> Caution is advised when BISPHOSPHONATES are administered with aminoglycosides, calcitonin or LOOP DIURETICS,  since these agents may have an additive effect, resulting in a lower serum CALCIUM level for longer periods than required (see section 4.4) . 
> In multiple myeloma patients, the risk of renal dysfunction may be increased when ZOLEDRONIC ACID is used in combination with THALIDOMIDE.
