> The initial release of cytokines associated with the start of COLUMVI treatment could suppress CYP450 ENZYMES. The highest drug- drug interaction risk is during the period of one week following each of the first 2 doses o f COLUMVI  (i.e., Cycle 1 Day 8 and 15) in patients who are receiving concomitant CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., WARFARIN, CYCLOSPORINE). On initiation of COLUMVI  therapy, patients being treated with CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index should be monitored.
