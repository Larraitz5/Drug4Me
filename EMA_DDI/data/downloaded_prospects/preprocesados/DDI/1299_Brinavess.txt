> Although VERNAKALANT is a substrate of CYP2D6, population pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses demonstrated that no substantial differences in the acute exposure of VERNAKALANT (C max and AUC 0-90min) were observed when weak or potent CYP2D6  inhibi tors were administered within 1  day prior to VERNAKALANT infusion compared to patients that were not on concomitant t herapy with CYP2D6  inhibitors. In addition, acute exposure of VERNAKALANT in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 is only minimally different when compared to that of extensive metabolisers.  No dose adjustment of vernakala nt is required on the basis of CYP2D6 metaboliser status, or when VERNAKALANT is administered  concurrently with  2D6 inhibitors.
