> Thalidomide has sedative properties, thus may enhance the sedation induced by ANXIOLYTICS, hypnotics, ANTIPSYCHOTICS, H
1 antihistamines, opiate derivatives, barbiturates and alcohol. Caution should be used when thalidomide is given in combination with medicinal products that cause drowsiness.   Bradycardic effect 
> Thalidomide does not interact with hormonal contraceptives. In 10 healthy women, the pharmacokinetic profiles of NORETHINDRONE and ETHINYL ESTRADIOL following administration of a single dose containing 1.0 mg of NORETHINDRONE acetate and 0.75 mg of ETHINYL ESTRADIOL were studied. The results were similar with and without co -administration of thalidomide 200  mg/day to steady -state levels. However, combined hormonal contraceptives are not recommended due to the increased risk of venous thromboembolic disease.   WARFARIN 
> Multiple dose administration of 200  mg thalidomide q.d. for 4 days had no effect on the international normalized ratio (INR) in healthy volunteers. However, due to the increased risk of thrombosis in cancer patients, and a potentially accelerated metabolism of WARFARIN with CORTICOSTEROIDS, close monitoring of INR values is advised during thalidomide-PREDNISONE combi nation treatment as well as during the first weeks after ending these treatments.
