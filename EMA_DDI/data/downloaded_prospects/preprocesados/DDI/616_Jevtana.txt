>  CYP3A i nhibitors  Repeated admin istration of KETOCONAZOLE (400 mg once daily), a strong CYP3A inhibitor, resulted in a 
20% decrease in cabazitaxel clearance corresponding to a 25%  increase in AUC. Therefore concomitant administration of strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., KETOCONAZOLE, ITRACONAZOLE, CLARITHROMYCIN, INDINAVIR, NEFAZODONE, NELFINAVIR, RITONAVIR, SAQUINAVIR, TELITHROMYCIN, VORICONAZOLE) should be avoided as an increase of plasma concentration s of cabazitaxel may occur (see section s 4.2 and 4.4).   Concomitant administration of ap repitant, a moderate CYP3A inhibitor, had no effect on cabazitaxel clearance. 
> 7 CYP3A inducers Repeated administration of RIFAMPIN (600 mg once dail y), a strong CYP3A inducer, resulted in an increase in cabazitaxel clearance of 21% corresponding to a decrea se in AUC of 17%.  Therefore concomitant administration of strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., PHENYTOIN, CARBAMAZEPINE, RIFAMPIN, RIFABUTIN, rifapentin, PHENOBARBITAL) should be avoided as a decrease of plasma concentration s of cabazitaxel may occur (see s ection s 4.2 and 4.4 ). In addition, patients should also refrain from taking St. John’s Wort.  OATP1B1  In vitro , cabazitaxel has also been shown to inhib it the transport proteins of the Organic Anion Transport Polypeptides OATP1B1. The risk of interaction with O ATP1B1 substrates (e.g. statins, VALSARTAN, REPAGLINIDE)  is possible , notably during the infusion duration (1 hour) and up to 20 minutes  after the end of the infusion. A time interval of 12 hours is recommended before the infusion and at least 3 hours afte r the end of infusion before administering the OATP1B1 substrates.
