> Based on in vitro  data, RUXOLITINIB is predominantly cleared by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) metabolism. Interaction potential was evaluated for oral RUXOLITINIB in dedicated clinical pharmacology studies that included co -administration of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors or a strong inducer. The plasma AUC is approximately doubled with co -administration of a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 while only a modest increase was seen with co -administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor. 
> The use of RUXOLITINIB cream in combination with other topical medicinal products used to treat vitiligo has not been evaluated and co -application on the same skin areas is not recommended.
