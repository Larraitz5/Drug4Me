> In a study of 15 healthy subjects administered DIGOXIN daily to steady state, a single FORSTEO dose did not alter the cardiac effect of DIGOXIN. However, sporadic case repo rts have s ugge sted that hypercalcaemia may predispo se patients to dig italis toxicity. Because FORSTEO transiently increases serum CALCIUM, FORSTEO should be used with caution in patients taking digitalis.
> Co-administration of RALOXIFENE or hormone replacement therapy with FORSTEO did not alter the effects of FORSTEO on serum or urine CALCIUM or on clinical adverse events.
