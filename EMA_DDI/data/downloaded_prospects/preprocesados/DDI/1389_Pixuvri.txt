> increas e in concentration resulting in THEOPHYLLINE toxicity. THEOPHYLLINE levels should be carefully monitored in the weeks immediately following initiation of PIXUVRI concurrent therapy. 
> WARFARIN  is partially metabolised by CYP1A2, therefore, a theoretical concern exists with regard to co-administration of this medicinal product and the effect inhibition of its metabolism might have on its intended action. Coagulation parameters, specifically international normalised ratio (INR), should be monitored in the days  immediately following the initiation of PIXUVRI concurrent therapy.
> AMITRIPTYLINE, HALOPERIDOL, CLOZAPINE, ONDANSETRON and PROPRANOLOL are  metabolised by CYP1A2, and therefore, a theoretical concern exists that co -administration of PIXUVRI may increase blood levels of this medicinal product. 
> Based on in vitro  studies, pixantrone was found to be a substrate for the membrane transport proteins P-gp/BRCP and OCT1 and agents which inhibit these transporters have the potential to d ecrease hepatic uptake and excretion efficiency of pixantrone. Blood counts should be closely monitored when co-administe red with agents which inhibit such transporters such as CYCLOSPORINE A or TACROLIMUS, commonly used to control chronic graft-versus-hos t disease, and the anti -HIV agents RITONAVIR, SAQUINAVIR, or NELFINAVIR.  In addition, caution should be taken when pixantrone is continuously co- administered with efflux transport inducers such as rifampicin, carbamazepin and GLUCOCORTICOIDS, as pixantron e excretion might be increased with a consequent decrease of systemic exposure.
