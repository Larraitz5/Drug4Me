> Due to a potential increase of haematologi cal toxicity and bone marrow suppression, cladribine must not be used concomitantly with other myelosuppressive medicinal products. An influence of cladribine on the activity of OTHER ANTINEOPLASTIC AGENTS  has not been observed  in vitro  (e.g. DOXORUBICIN, VINCRISTINE, CYTARABINE, CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE) and in vivo . However, an in vitro  study r evealed cross -resistance between cladribine and NITROGEN mustard (CHLORMETHINE); for CYTARABINE, one author has described an in vivo  cross -reaction without loss of activity . 
> Since interactions with  medicinal products undergoing intracellular phosphorylation, such as antiviral agents, or with inhibitors of ADENOSINE uptake may be expected, their concomitant use with cladribine is not recommended.
