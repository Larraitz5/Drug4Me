> CARVYKTI required TOCILIZUMAB ,CORTICOSTEROIDS and anakinrafor management of CRS . CARVYKTI continues to expand and persist following TOCILIZUMAB administration. In Study MMY2001, p atients treated with TOCILIZUMAB (n=6 8) had 81% and 72% higher CARVYKTI Cmaxand AUC 0-28d, respectively, as compared to patients (n= 29) who did not receive TOCILIZUMAB. Patients who received CORTICOSTEROIDS (n=28) had 75% and 112% higher C maxand AUC 0-28d, respect ively, compared with patients who did not receive CORTICOSTEROIDS (n=69). In addition, patients who received ANAKINRA (n=20) had 41% and 7 2% higher C maxand AUC 0-28d,respectively, compared with patients who did not receive ANAKINRA (n=77). In Study MMY300 2, the results related to TOCILIZUMAB and corticosteroid were consistent with Study MMY2001.Live VACCINES
