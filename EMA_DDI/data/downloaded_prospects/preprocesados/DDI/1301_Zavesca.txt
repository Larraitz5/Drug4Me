> Limited data suggest that co -administration of ZAVESCA and enzyme replacement with IMIGLUCERASE in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease may result in decreased exposure to miglustat (approximate reductions of 22% in C maxand 14% in AUC were observed in a small parallel -group study). This study alsoindicated that ZAVESCA has no or limited effect on the pharmacokinetics of IMIGLUCERASE .
