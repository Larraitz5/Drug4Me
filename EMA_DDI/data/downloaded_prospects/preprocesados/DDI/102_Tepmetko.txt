> TEPOTINIB is a substrate for P- glycoprotein (P -gp). In healthy participants, co- administration of a single 
450 mg TEPOTINIB dose with the strong inducer CARBAMAZEPINE (300 mg twice daily for 14 days) decreased TEPOTINIB AUC inf by 35% and C max by 11% compared to administration of TEPOTINIB alone. The decreased exposure is not clinically relevant. 
> In healthy participants, co- administration of a single 450 mg TEPOTINIB dose with the strong CYP3A inhibitor and P -gp inhibitor ITRACONAZOLE (200 mg once daily for 11 days) increased TEPOTINIB AUC inf by 22% with no change in TEPOTINIB C max compared to administration of TEPOTINIB alone. This is classified as a weak interaction, and the observed changes in systemic exposure to TEPOTINIB are not considered clinically relevant. Therefore, CYP3A and P-gp inhibitors  are not expected to influence TEPOTINIB exposur e.
> Co-administration of OMEPRAZOLE under fed conditions had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of a single dose of TEPOTINIB 450 mg and its metabolites (geometric mean ratio for TEPOTINIB of 110% for AUCinf (90% CI: 102; 119) and of 104% for C max (90% CI: 93; 117); similar effect on metabolites observed).  6  Effects of TEPOTINIB on other medicinal products
> TEPOTINIB is an inhibitor of P -gp. Administration of TEPOTINIB 450  mg orally once daily for 8 days increased the AUC of the sensitive P -gp substrate DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE by approximately 50% and C max by approximately 40%. Dose adjustment of DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE may be needed in case of concomitant use. Caution and monitoring for adverse reactions of other P-gp- dependent substances with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. DIGOXIN, ALISKIREN, EVEROLIMUS, SIROLIMUS) is recommended during co-administration with TEPMETKO.
