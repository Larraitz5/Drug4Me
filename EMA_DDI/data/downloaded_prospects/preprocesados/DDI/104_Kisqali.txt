> Substances that may increase RIBOCICLIB plasma concentrations 
> RIBOCICLIB is primarily metabolised by CYP3A 4. Therefore, medicinal products that can influence CYP3A4 enzyme activity may alter the pharmacokinetics of RIBOCICLIB. Co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor RITONAVIR  (100 mg twice daily for 14  days) with a single 400  mg dose of RIBOCICLIB increased RIBOCICLIB exposure (AUC inf) and the peak concentration (C max) in healthy subjects 
3.2 and 1.7 -fold, respectively, relative to a single 400  mg RIBOCICLIB dose given alone . Cmax and AUC last for LEQ803 (a prominent metabolite of RIBOCICLIB accounting f or less than 10% of parent exposure) decreased by 96% and 98%, respectively.  Physiologically -based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) simulation estimated that co -administration of RITONAVIR (100  mg twice daily) with multiple daily doses of RIBOCICLIB may increase RIBOCICLIB steady -state C max and AUC 0-24h by 1. 5- and 1. 8-fold, respectively. 
> The concomitant use of strong CYP3A 4 inhibitors including, but not limited to,  the following must be avoided:  CLARITHROMYCIN, INDINAVIR, ITRACONAZOLE, KETOCONAZOLE, LOPINAVIR,  RITONAVIR, NEFAZODONE, NELFINAVIR, POSACONAZOLE, SAQUINAVIR, TELAPREVIR, TELITHROMYCIN, VERAPAMIL and VORICONAZOLE (see section 4.4). Alternative concomitant medic inal products  with less potential to inhibit CYP3A 4 should be considered and patients should be monitored for RIBOCICLIB -related ARs (see sections  4.2, 4.4 and 
5.2).
> If co-administration of KISQALI with a strong CYP3A 4 inhibitor cannot be avoided, the dose of KISQALI should be reduced as described in section  4.2. However, there are no clinical data with these dose adjustment s. Due to inter -patient variability, the recommended dose adjustments may n ot be optimal in all patients , therefore close monitoring for RIBOCICLIB -related A Rs is recommended. In the event  of RIBOCICLIB -related toxicity, the dose should be modified or treatment should be interrupted until toxicity is resolved  (see sections  4.2 and 5.2) . If the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, and after at least 
5 half-lives of the CYP3A4 inhibitor (refer to the Sm
> Physiologically -based  pharmacokinetic simulations  suggested that for a 600  mg dose of RIBOCICLIB, a  moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (ERYTHROMYCIN) may increase RIBOCICLIB steady -state Cmax and AUC 
1.1-fold and 1. 1-fold, respectively.  For patients who had their RIBOCICLIB dose reduced to 400  mg once daily, the increase of the steady -state C max and AUC was estimated to be 1. 1- and 1.2-fold, respectively. The effect at the 200  mg once -daily dose was predicted to be a 1. 3- and 1.5-fold increase, respectively. No dose adjustments of RIBOCICLIB are required  at initiation of treatment with  mild or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors.  However, monitoring of RIBOCICLIB -related A Rs is recommended.

  10 Patients should be instructed to avoid grapefruit or GRAPEFRUIT JUICE . These  are known to inhibit cytochrome CYP3A 4 ENZYMES and may increase the exposure to RIBOCICLIB. 
> Substances that may decrease RIBOCICLIB plasma concentrations 
> Co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampi cin (600 mg daily for 14  days) with a single 
600 mg dose of RIBOCICLIB decreased the RIBOCICLIB AUC inf and C max by 89% and 81%, respectively, relative to a single 600  mg RIBOCICLIB dose given alone in healthy subjects. LEQ803 C max increased 
1.7-fold and AUC inf decreased by 27%, respectively. The concomitant use of strong CYP3A 4 inducers may therefore lead to decreased exposure and consequently a risk for lack of efficacy. The concomitant use of strong CYP3A 4 inducers should be avoided, including, but not limited to, PHENYTOIN, rifampi cin, CARBAMAZEPINE and St Johnâ€™s Wort  (Hypericum perforatum) . An alternative concomitant medicinal product with no or minimal potential to induce CYP3A 4 should be considered. 
> The effect of a moderate CYP3A4 inducer on RIBOCICLIB exposure has not been studied.  Physiologically -based pharmacokinetic simulations suggested that a moderate CYP3A 4 inducer (EFAVIRENZ) may decrease steady -state RIBOCICLIB C max and AUC by 51% and 70%, respectively.  The concomitant use of moderate CYP3A4 inducers may therefore lead to decreased exposure and consequently a risk for impaired efficacy, in particular in patients treated with RIBOCICLIB at 400  mg or 
200 mg once daily. 
> RIBOCICLIB is a moderate to strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and may interact with medicinal substrates that are metabolised via CYP3A4 , which can lead to increased serum concentrations of the concomitantly used medicinal  product. 
> Co-administration of MIDAZOLAM (CYP3A4 substrate) with multiple doses of KISQALI (400 mg) increased the MIDAZOLAM exposure by 280% (3.80 -fold) in healthy subjects, compared with administration of MIDAZOLAM alone. Simulations using physiologically -based pharmacokinetic  models suggested that KISQALI given at the clinically relevant dose of 600  mg is expected to increase the MIDAZOLAM AUC by 5.2 -fold. Therefore, in general, when RIBOCICLIB is co -administered with other medicinal products, the Sm

Caution is recommended in case of concomitant use  with sensitive  CYP3A 4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index  (see section  4.4). The dose of a sensitive CYP3A 4 substrate with a narrow therapeutic index, including but not limited to ALFENTANIL, c iclosporin , EVEROLIMUS, FENTANYL, sirol imus and TACROLIMUS, may need to be reduced as RIBOCICLIB can increase their exposure. 
> Concomitant administration of RIBOCICLIB at the 600  mg dose with the following CYP3A 4 substrates should  be avoided: ALFUZOSIN, AMIODARONE, CISAPRIDE, PIMOZIDE, QUINIDINE, ERGOTAMINE, DIHYDROERGOTAMINE, QUETIAPINE, LOVASTATIN, SIMVASTATIN, s ildenafil, MIDAZOLAM, TRIAZOLAM .
> Co-administration of CAFFEINE (CYP1A2 substrate) with multiple doses of KISQALI (400 mg) increased the CAFFEINE exposure by 20% (1.20 -fold) in healthy subjects, compared with administration of CAFFEINE alone. At the clinically relevant dose of 600  mg, simulations using PBPK models predicted only weak inhibitory effects of RIBOCICLIB on CYP1A2 substrates (<2 -fold increase in AUC). 
> In vitro  evaluations indicated that RIBOCICLIB  has a potential to inhibit the activities of drug transporters P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1/ 1B3, OCT1 , OCT2, MATE1 and BSEP. Caution and monitoring for toxicity are advised during concomitant treatment with sensitive substrates of these transporters which exhibit a narrow therapeutic index, including but not limited to  DIGOXIN,  PITAVASTATIN , PRAVASTATIN , ROSUVASTATIN and METFORMIN .

KISQALI is also not recommended to be used in combination with TAMOXIFEN (see sections  4.1, 4.4 and 5.1 ).
