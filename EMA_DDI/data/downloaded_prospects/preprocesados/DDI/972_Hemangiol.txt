> Bradycardia –inducing CALCIUM -channel blockers (d iltiazem , VERAPAMIL , BEPRIDIL )  Co-administration with  PROPRANOLOL can cause altered automaticity (excessive bradycardia, sinus arrest), sino -atrial and atrio -ventricular conduction disorders, and increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias (torsades de pointes) along with heart failure.  This combination must only be administered under close clinical and ECG monitoring, particularly at the start of the treatment. 
> Antiarrhythmics  
• PROPAFENONE has negative inotropic and beta -blocking properties that can be additive to those of PROPRANOLOL . 
• The metabolism of PROPRANOLOL is reduced by co- administration of QUINIDINE, leading to a two-three -fold increased blood concentration and greater degrees of clinical beta- blockade .  
• AMIODARONE is an antiarrhythmic agent with negative chronotropic properties that may be addi tive to those seen with β -blockers such as PROPRANOLOL. Automatism and conduction disorders are expected because of the suppression of sympathetic compensative mechanisms . 
• The metabolism of intravenous LIDOCAINE is inhibited by co- administration of PROPRANOLOL, resulting in a 25% increase in LIDOCAINE concentrations. LIDOCAINE toxicity (neurological and cardiac adverse events) has been reported following co- administration with PROPRANOLOL. 
> Digitalis g lycosides Both DIGITALIS GLYCOSIDES and beta -blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia.  The advice of a cardiologist should be sought .
> ANTIHYPERTENSIVES (ACE Inhibitors, angiotensin II -receptors antagonists, DIURETICS, alpha -blockers whatever the indication, centrally -acting ANTIHYPERTENSIVES , RESERPINE, etc)  7 When combined with beta -blockers, medicinal products that decrease arterial pressure can cause or increase hypotension, notably orthostatic. With  regard to  centrally -acting ANTIHYPERTENSIVES , beta-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension after  CLONIDINE  abrupt withdrawal , and PROPRANOLOL should be stopped several days before discontinuing CLONIDINE .
> CORTICOSTEROIDS  Patients with infantile haemangioma may be at increased risk if they have received or are concomitantly receiving treatment w ith CORTICOSTEROIDS because adrenal suppression may result in loss of the counterregulatory cortisol response and increase the risk of hypoglycaemia. This also applies when children are breastfed by mothers treated with CORTICOSTEROIDS in case of high dosage or prolonged treatment  (see section 4.4 concerning hypoglycaemia ). 
> Enzyme inducers  Blood levels of PROPRANOLOL may be decreased by co- administration of enzyme inducers like rifampicin  or PHENOBARBITAL .
> Hypoglycaemic agents  All beta -blocking agents can mask certain symptoms of hypoglycaemia: palpitations and tachycardia.  Use of proprano lol alongside hypoglycaemic therapy in diabetic patients should be with caution since it may prolong the hypoglycaemic response to insulin. In this case, inform the caregiver, and increase monitoring of blood GLUCOSE levels, particularly at the start of tr eatment. 
> Lipid lowering medicinal products   Co-administration of CHOLESTYRAMINE or COLESTIPOL with PROPRANOLOL resulted in up to 50% decrease in PROPRANOLOL concentrations.
