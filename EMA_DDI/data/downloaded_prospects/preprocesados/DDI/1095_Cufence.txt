> There are insufficient data to support the  concomitant use of ZINC and trientine. The combination of trientine with ZINC is not recommended as interaction of ZINC with trientine is likely, th ereby  reducing the effect of both active substances. 
> No interaction studies have been performed on the concomitant administration of trientine with D-PENICILLAMINE. 
> Trientine has been found to reduce serum IRON levels.  Therefore, i ron supplementation may be necessary in some cases. Concomitant oral IRON  or other heavy metals should be administred at a different time  than trientine to prevent the formation of complexes (see section  4.4).
