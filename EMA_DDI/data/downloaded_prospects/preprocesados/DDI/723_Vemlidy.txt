> TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE  is transported by P -gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) . Medicinal products  that are P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampicin , RIFABUTIN, CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENOBARBITAL  or St. John’s  wort) are expected to  decrease plasma concentrations of TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE, which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of VEMLIDY. Co-administration of such medicinal products with TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE is not recommended.  6  Co-administration of TENOFOVIR alafen amide with medicinal products that inhibit P -gp and BCRP  may increase plasma concentration s of TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE.  Co-administration of strong inhibitors of P-gp with TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE is not recommended. 
> Drug interaction information for VEMLIDY  with potential concomitant medicinal products is summarised in Table 1 below (increase is indicated as “↑”, de crease as “↓”, no change as “↔”;  twice daily as “b.i.d.”, single  dose as “s.d.”, once daily as “q.d.”).  The drug interactions described are based on studies conducted with TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE, or are potential drug interactions that may occur with VEMLIDY .
