> Based on the in vitro  and clinical data,  the potential for maraviroc to affect the pharmacokinetics of co-administered medicinal products is low.   In vitro  studies have shown that maraviroc does not inhibit OATP1B1, MRP2 or any of  the major P450 ENZYMES at clinically relevant concentrations (CYP 1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4). Maraviroc had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of MIDAZOLAM, the oral contraceptives ethinylestradiol and LEVONORGESTREL, or urinary 6β -hydroxycortisol/cortisol ratio, suggestin g no inhibition or induction of CYP3A4 in vivo . At higher exposure of maraviroc a potential inhibition of CYP2D6 cannot be excluded.  
>  Renal clearance accounts for approximately 23% of total clearance of maraviroc when maraviroc is administered without CYP3A4 inhibitors. In vitro  studies have shown that maraviroc does not inhibit any of the major renal uptake transporters  at clinically re levant concentrations (OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, OCTN1, and OCTN2). Additionally,  co-administration of maraviroc  with TENOFOVIR (substrate for renal elimination) and cotrimoxazole (contains TRIMETHOPRIM, a renal cation transport inhibitor), showed no effect on the  pharmacokinetics of maraviroc. In addition, co -administration of maraviroc  with LAMIVUDINE/ZIDOVUDINE showed no effect of maraviroc on LAMIVUDINE (primarily renally cleared) or ZIDOVUDINE (non -P450 metabolism and renal clearance) pharmacokinetics.  Maravi roc inhibits P -glycoprotein in vitro  (IC 50 is 183 μM). However, maraviroc does not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of DIGOXIN in vivo .  It may not be excluded that maraviroc can increase the exposure to the P -glycoprotein substrate DABIGATRAN ete xilate.

 Maraviroc AUC : ↓ 0.37  Maraviroc C max: ↓ 0.34  Rifampicin concentrations not measured, no effect expected.  CELSENTRI dose should be increased to 600  mg twice daily when co-administered with rifampicin in the absence of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor.  This dose adjustment has not been studied in HIV patients. See also section 4.4.  Rifampicin + EFAVIRENZ  Combination with two inducers has not been studied.
