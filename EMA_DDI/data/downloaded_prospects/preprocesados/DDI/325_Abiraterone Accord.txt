> Effect of food on ABIRATERONE ACETATE  Administration with food significantly increases the absorpti on of ABIRATERONE ACETATE. The efficacy and safety when given with food have not been established therefore this medicinal product must not be taken with food (see sections 4.2 and 5.2) .
> Interactions with other medicinal products  Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABIRATERONE exposures  In a clinical pharmacokinetic interaction study of healthy subjects pretreated with a strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin, 600 mg daily for 6 days followed by a single dose of ABIRATERONE ACETATE 1000 mg, the mean plasma AUC âˆž of ABIRATERONE ACETATE was decreased by 55%. 
> Potential to affect exposures to other medicinal products  ABIRATERONE ACETATE  is an inhibitor of the hepatic medicinal product -metaboli sing ENZYMES CYP2D6 and CYP2C8.  In a study to determine the effects of ABIRATERONE ACETATE (plus PREDNISONE) on a single dose of the CYP2D6 substrate DEXTROMETHORPHAN, the systemic exposure (AUC) of DEXTROMETHORPHAN was increased approximately 2.9  fold. The AUC  
24 for dextrorphan, the active metabolite of DEXTROMETHORPHAN, increased approximately 33%. 
> In a CYP2C8 medicinal product interaction study  in healthy subjects, the AUC of PIOGLITAZONE was increased by 46% and the AUCs for M -III and M -IV, the active metabolites of PIOGLITAZONE, each decreased by 10% when PIOGLITAZONE  was given together with a single dose of 1000 mg ABIRATERONE ACETATE.  Patients should be monitored for signs of toxicity related to a CYP2C8 substrate with a narrow therapeutic index if used concomitantly.  Examples of medicinal product s metaboli sed by CYP2C8 include PIOGLITAZONE and REPAGLINIDE (see section 4.4). 
> In vitro , the major metabolites ABIRATERONE sulphate and N-oxide ABIRATERONE sulphate were shown to inhibit the hepatic uptake transporter OATP1B1 and as a consequence it may increase the 7 conc entrations of medicinal products eliminated by OATP1B1. There are no clinical data available to confirm transporter based interaction. 
> Use with SPIRONOLACTONE  SPIRONOLACTONE binds to the androgen receptor and may increase prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels. Use with ABIRATERONE acetat e is not recommended (see section  5.1).
