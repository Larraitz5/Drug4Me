> No interaction studies have been performed. Retrospective analyses of clinical studies did not reveal any clinically relevant interactions with medicinal product used concomitantly with reteplase in patients with acute myocardial infarction. HEPARIN, VITAMIN K ANTAGONISTS and medicinal product that alter platelet function (such as acetylsalicylic acid, DIPYRIDAMOLE and ABCIXIMAB) may increase the risk of bleeding if administered prior to, during or after reteplase therapy.
