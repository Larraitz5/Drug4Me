> Co-administration of dexmedetomidine with anaesthetics, sedatives, hypnotics, and OPIOIDS is likely to lead to an enhancement of effects, including sedative, anaesthetic and cardiorespiratory effects . Specific studies have confirmed  enhanced  effects with ISOFLURANE, PROPOFOL, ALFENTANIL, and MIDAZOLAM. 
> No pharmacokinetic interactions between dexmedetomidine  and ISOFLURANE, PROPOFOL, ALFENTANIL and MIDAZOLAM have been demonstrated. However, due to possible pharmacodynamic interactions, when co-administered with dexmedetomidine , a reduction in dosage of dexmedetomidine  or the concomitant anaesth etic, sedative, hypnotic or opioid may be required.
