> Fampridine is eliminated mainly via the kidneys with active renal secretion accounting for about 60% (see section 5.2). OCT2 is the tran sporter responsible for the active secretion of fampridine. Thus, the concomitant use of fampridine with medicinal products that are inhibitors of OCT2 for example, CIMETIDINE are contraindicated (see section 4.3) and concomitant use of fampridine with med icinal products that are substrates of OCT2 for example, CARVEDILOL, PROPRANOLOL and METFORMIN is cautioned (see section 4.4.)
