> No interaction studies have been performed. Since the systemic exposure of the main component betulin following cutaneous application is negligible no interaction with systemic treatments is expected. Interactions with topical products have not been investigated in clinical trials. Other topical products should not be concomitantly used together with FILSUVEZ but rather sequentially or alternatively depending on the clinical need.  4
