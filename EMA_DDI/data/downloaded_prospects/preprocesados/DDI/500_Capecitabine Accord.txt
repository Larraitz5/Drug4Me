> BRIVUDINE: a clinically significant interaction between BRIVUDINE and fluoropyrimidines (e.g. capecitabine, 5 -FLUOROURACIL, TEGAFUR), resulting from the inhibition of dihydropyrimidine 11 dehydrogenase by BRIVUDINE, has been described. This interaction, which  leads to increased fluoropyrimidine toxicity, is potentially fatal. Therefore, BRIVUDINE must not be administered concomitantly with  capecitabine  (see section  4.3 and 4.4). There must be at least a 4 -week waiting period between end of treatment with bri vudine and start of capecitabine therapy. Treatment with BRIVUDINE can be started 24 hours after the last dose of capecitabine. 
> Cytochrome P -450 2C9 substrates   Other than WARFARIN, no formal interaction studies between capecitabine and other CYP2C9 substrates have been conducted. Care should be exercised when capecitabine is co -administered with 2C9 substrates (e.g., PHENYTOIN). See also interaction with COUMARIN -derivative anticoagulants below, and section 4.4. 
> COUMARIN -derivative anticoagulants  Altered coagulation parameters and/or bleeding have been reported in patients taking capecitabine concomitantly with COUMARIN -derivative anticoagulants such as WARFARIN and PHENPROCOUMON. These reactions occurred within several days and up to several month s after initiating capecitabine therapy and, in a few cases, within one month after stopping capecitabine.In a clinical pharmacokinetic interaction study, after a single 20  mg dose of WARFARIN, capecitabine treatment increased the AUC of S-WARFARIN by 57% with a 91% increase in INR value. Since metabolism of R -WARFARIN was not affected, these results indicate that capecitabine down -regulates isozyme 2C9, but has no effect on isozymes 1A2 and 3A4. Patients taking COUMARIN -derivative anticoagulants concomitan tly with capecitabine should be monitored regularly for alterations in their coagulation parameters (PT or INR) and the anticoagulant  dose adjusted accordingly. 
> PHENYTOIN  Increased PHENYTOIN plasma concentrations resulting in symptoms of PHENYTOIN intoxic ation in single cases have been reported during concomitant use of capecitabine with PHENYTOIN. Patients taking PHENYTOIN concomitantly with capecitabine should be regularly monitored for increased PHENYTOIN plasma concentrations. 
> Folinic acid/FOLIC ACID   A combination study with capecitabine and folinic acid indicated that folinic acid has no major effect on the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine and its metabolites. However, folinic acid has an effect on the pharmacodynamics of capecitabine and its toxicit y may be enhanced by folinic acid: the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of capecitabine alone using the intermittent regimen is 3000  mg/m2 per day whereas it is only 2000  mg/m2 per day when capecitabine was combined with folinic acid (30  mg orally bid). The en hanced toxicity may be relevant when switching from 5 -FU/LV to a capecitabine regimen. This may also be relevant with FOLIC ACID supplementation for folate deficiency due to the similarity between folinic acid and FOLIC ACID. 
> Antacid  The effect of an ALUMINIUM  hydroxide and MAGNESIUM HYDROXIDE -containing antacid on the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine was investigated. There was a small increase in plasma concentrations of capecitabine and one metabolite (5’ -DFCR); there was no effect on the 3 major metabolites (5’ -DFUR, 5 -FU and FBAL). 
> ALLOPURINOL  Interactions with ALLOPURINOL have been observed for 5 -FU; with possible decreased efficacy of 5 -FU. Concomitant use of ALLOPURINOL with capecitabine should be avoided. 
> OXALIPLATIN   No clinically significant differences in exposure to capecitabine or its metabolites, free PLATINUM or total PLATINUM occurred when capecitabine was administered in combination with OXALIPLATIN or in combination with OXALIPLATIN and BEVACIZUMAB.
