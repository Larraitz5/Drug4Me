> In a clinical study in healthy volunteers, CIMETIDINE, an inhibitor of organic cation transport which is thought to contribute to the renal excretion of glycopyrronium, increased total exposure (AUC) to glycopyr ronium by 22% and decreased renal clearance by 23%. Based on the magnitude of these changes, no clinically relevant drug interaction is expect ed when glycopyrronium  is co-administered with CIMETIDINE or other inhibitors of organic cation transport.
