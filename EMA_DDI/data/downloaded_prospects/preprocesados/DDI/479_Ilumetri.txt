> Concomitant medicinal products affecting tildrakizumab  pharmacokinetics are not expected since it is cleared from the body by general protein catabolism processes with no contribution of cytochrome P450 ( CYP450) ENZYMES, and it is not eliminated by renal or hepatic pathways. Furthermore, tildrakizumab  does not impact the pharmacokinetics of concomitant medicinal products metabolised by CYP450 ENZYMES either through direct or indirect mechanisms (see section  5.2).
