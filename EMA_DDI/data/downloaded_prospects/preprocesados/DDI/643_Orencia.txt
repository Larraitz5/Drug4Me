> No major safety issues were identified with use of abatacept in combination with SULFASALAZINE, HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE, or LEFLUNOMIDE. 
> Co-administration of abatacept with biologic immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents could potentiate the effects of abatacept on the immune system. There is insufficient evidence to assess the safety and efficacy of abatacept  in combination with ANAKINRA or RITUXIMAB (see section  4.4).
