> Based on the results from a study with paracetamol, which was used as a model medicinal product to evaluate the effect of tirzepatide on gastric emptying, n o dose adjustments are expected to be required for most  concomitant ly administered oral  medicinal products . However, it is recommended to m onitor patients on oral medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., WARFARIN , DIGOXIN ), especially at initiation of tirzepatide  treatment and following dose increase.  The risk of delayed effect should also be considered for oral medicinal products for which a rapid onset of effect is of importance. 
> Administration of a combination oral contraceptive (0. 035 mg ETHINYL ESTRADIOL plus 0. 25 mg NORGESTIMATE, a prodrug of nor elgestromin) in the presence of a single dose of tirzepatide ( 5 mg) resulted in a reduction of oral contraceptive C max and area under the curve (AUC) . ETHINYL ESTRADIOL Cmax was reduced by 59 % and AUC by  20 % with a  delay in t max of 4 hours . NORELGESTROMIN C max was reduced by 55 % and AUC by  23 % with a  delay in t max of 4.5 hours. NORGESTIMATE C max was reduced by 66 %, and AUC by  20 % with a  delay in t max of 2.5 hours.  This reduction in exposure after a single dose of tirzepatide is not considered clinically relevant.   No dose adjustment of oral contraceptives is required .
