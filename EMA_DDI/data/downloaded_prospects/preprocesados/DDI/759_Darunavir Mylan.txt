> Darunavir and RITONAVIR are inhibitors of CYP3A, CYP2D6 and P -gp. Co -administration of darunavir/ RITONAVIR with medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP3A and/or CYP2D6 or transported by P-gp may result in increased systemic exp osure to such medicinal products, which could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions.  9  Co-administration of darunavir/RITONAVIR with drugs that have active metabolite(s) formed by CYP3A may result in reduced plasma concentration s of these active metabolite(s), potentially leading to loss of their therapeutic effect (see the Interaction table below). 
> Darunavir co -administered with low dose RITONAVIR must not be combined with medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP3A f or clearance and for which increased systemic exposure is associated with serious and/or life -threatening events (narrow therapeutic index) (see section 4.3). 
> The overall pharmacokinetic enhancement effect by RITONAVIR was an approximate 14 -fold increase in the systemic exposure of darunavir when a single dose of 600 mg darunavir was given orally in combination with RITONAVIR at 100 mg twice daily. Therefore, darunavir must only be used in combination with low dose RITONAVIR as a pharmacokinetic e nhancer (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
> A clinical study utilising a cocktail of medicinal products that are metabolised by cytochromes CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 demonstrated an increase in CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 activity and inhibition of CYP2D6 activity in the  presence of darunavir/RITONAVIR, which may be attributed to the presence of low dose RITONAVIR. Co -administration of darunavir and RITONAVIR with medicinal products which are primarily metabolised by CYP2D6 (such as FLECAINIDE, PROPAFENONE, METOPROLOL) ma y result in increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products, which could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions. Co -administration of darunavir and RITONAVIR with medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP2C9 (s uch as WARFARIN) and CYP2C19 (such as METHADONE) may result in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could decrease or shorten their therapeutic effect. 
> Although the effect on CYP2C8 has only been studied in vitro , co-administratio n of darunavir and RITONAVIR and medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP2C8 (such as PACLITAXEL, ROSIGLITAZONE, REPAGLINIDE) may result in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could decrease or shorten their therapeutic eff ect.
> RITONAVIR inhibits the transporters P -glycoprotein, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, and co -administration with substrates of these transporters can result in increased plasma concentrations of these compounds (e.g. DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE, DIGOXIN, statins and bos entan; see the Interaction table below). 
> Medicinal products that affect darunavir/RITONAVIR exposure  Darunavir and RITONAVIR are metabolised by CYP3A. Medicinal products that induce CYP3A activity would be expected to increase the clearance of darunavir a nd RITONAVIR, resulting in lowered plasma concentrations of darunavir and RITONAVIR (e.g. rifampicin, St John’s wort, LOPINAVIR).  Co-administration of darunavir and RITONAVIR and other medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A may decrease the clearance of dar unavir and RITONAVIR and may result in increased plasma concentrations of darunavir and RITONAVIR (e.g. INDINAVIR, azole antifungals like CLOTRIMAZOLE). These interactions are described in the interaction table below.

> (RIFABUTIN is an inducer and substrate of CYP3A.) An increase of systemic exposure to darunavir was observed when darunavir co -administered with 
100 mg RITONAVIR was co -administered with RIFABUTIN (150 mg once every other day).  A dosage reduction of RIFABUTIN by 
75% of the usual dose of 
300 mg/day (i.e. rifa butin 150 mg once every other day) and increased monitoring for RIFABUTIN related adverse events is warranted in patients receiving the combination with darunavir co - administered with RITONAVIR. In case of safety issues, a further increase of the dosing i nterval for RIFABUTIN and/or monitoring of RIFABUTIN levels should be considered.  Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate treatment of tuberculosis in HIV infected patients.  Based upon the safety profile of darunavir/RITONAVIR , the increase in darunavir exposure in the presence of RIFABUTIN does not warrant a dose adjustment for darunavir/RITONAVIR.

Greater effects ma y be expected when FLUTICASONE is inhaled. Systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression have been reported in patients receiving RITONAVIR and inhaled or intranasally administered FLUTICASONE. The effects of high FLUTICASONE systemic exposure on RITONAVIR plasma levels are unknown. 
> Other CORTICOSTEROIDS: interaction not studied.
