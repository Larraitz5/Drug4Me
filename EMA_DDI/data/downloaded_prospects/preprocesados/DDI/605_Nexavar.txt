> Administration of rifampicin for 5 days before administration of a single dose of sorafenib resulted in an average 37  % reduction of sorafenib AUC. Other inducers of CYP3A4 activity and/or glucuronidation (e.g. Hypericum perforatum also known as St. Johnâ€™s wort, PHENYTOIN, CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENOBARBITAL, and DEXAMETHASONE) may also increase metabolism of sorafenib and thus decrease sorafenib concentrations. 
> Sorafenib inhibited CYP2B6, CY P2C8 and CYP2C9 in vitro  with similar potency. However, in clinical pharmacokinetic studies, concomitant admini stration of sorafenib 400 mg twice daily  with CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE, a CYP2B6 substrate, or PACLITAXEL, a CYP2C8 substrate, did not result in a clinic ally meaningful inhibition. These data suggest that sorafenib at the recommended dose of 
400 mg twice daily  may not be an in vivo  inhibitor of CYP2B6 or CYP2C8.  Additionally, concomitant treatment with sorafenib and WARFARIN, a CYP2C9 substrate, did not r esult in changes in mean PT -INR compared to placebo. Thus, also the risk for a clinically relevant in vivo  inhibition of CYP2C9 by sorafenib may be expected to be low. However, patients taking WARFARIN or PHENPROCOUMON should have their INR checked regularly (see section 4.4). 
> Concomitant administration of sorafenib and MIDAZOLAM, DEXTROMETHORPHAN or OMEPRAZOLE, which are substrates for cytochromes CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 respectively, did not alter  the exposure of these agents. This indicates that sorafenib is neither an inhibitor nor an inducer of these cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Therefore, clinical pharmacokinetic interactions of sorafenib with substrates of these ENZYMES are unlikely.  
> In vitro , sorafenib has been shown to inhibit the transport protein p -glycoprotein (P -gp). Increased plasma concentrations of  P-gp substrates such as DIGOXIN cannot be excluded with concomitant treatment with sorafenib. 
> 8 o Co-administration of PACLITAXEL (225 mg/m2, once every 3 weeks) and CARBOPLATIN (AUC=6) with sorafenib (400 mg twice daily, without a break in sorafenib dosing) resulted in a 47% increase in sorafenib exposure, a 29% increase in PACLITAXEL e xposure and a 50% increase in 6 -OH PACLITAXEL exposure. The pharmacokinetics of CARBOPLATIN were unaffected. 
> These data indicate  no need for dose adjustments when PACLITAXEL and CARBOPLATIN are co -administered with sorafenib with a 3 -day break in sorafen ib dosing (two days prior to and on the day of PACLITAXEL/CARBOPLATIN administration). The clinical significance of the increases in sorafenib and PACLITAXEL exposure, upon co -administration of sorafenib without a break in dosing, is unknown. 
> Co-administration of CAPECITABINE (750 -1050 mg/m2 twice daily, Days 1 -14 every 21 days) and sorafenib (200 or 400  mg twice daily, continuous uninterrupted administration) resulted in no significant change in sorafenib exposure, but a 15 -50% increase in CAPECITABINE exposure and a 0 -52% increase in 5 -FU e xposure. The clinical significance of these small to modest increases in CAPECITABINE and 5 -FU exposure when co -administered with sorafenib is unknown. 
> Concomitant treatment with sorafenib  resulted in a 21  % incre ase in the AUC of DOXORUBICIN. When administered with IRINOTECAN, whose active metabolite SN -38 is further metabolised by the UGT1A1 pathway, there was a 67  - 120 % increase in the AUC of SN -38 and a 26  - 42 % increase in the AUC of IRINOTECAN. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown (see section  4.4).
> DOCETAXEL (75 or 100  mg/m2 administered once every 21 days) when co -administered with sorafenib (200 mg twice daily or 400 mg twice daily administered on Days 2 through 19 of a 21 -day cycle with a 3-day break in dosing around administration of DOCETAXEL) resulted in a 36 -80 % incre ase in DOCETAXEL AUC and a 16 -32 % increase in DOCETAXEL C max. Caution is recommended when sorafenib is co-administered with DOCETAXEL (see section  4.4).
> NEOMYCIN  Co-administration of NEOMYCIN, a non -systemic antimicrobial agent used to eradicate gastrointestinal flora, interferes with the enterohepatic recycling of sorafenib (see section 5.2, Metabolism and Elimination), resulting in decreased sorafenib exposure. In healthy volunteers treated with a 5 -day regimen of neomyci n the average exposure to sorafenib decreased by 54%. Effects of other ANTIBIOTICS have not been studied, but will likely depend on their ability to interfere with microorganisms with glucuronidase activity.
