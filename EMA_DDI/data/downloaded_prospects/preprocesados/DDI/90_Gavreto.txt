> CYP3A4 and/or  P-gp inhibitors  P-gp inhibitors: Co- administration of a single 200 mg dose  of pralsetinib  with  CYCLOSPORINE single 
600  mg  dose  (a P-gp and weak -moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor ) in healthy subjects increased pralsetinib AUC 0-∞ by 81% and C max by 48%, relative to a 200 mg dose of pralsetinib administered alone.   
> Combined P -gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors: Co -administration of 200 mg pralsetinib once daily with ITRACONAZOLE 200 mg once daily (a P -gp inhibitor and strong CYP3A4) increased pralsetinib  AUC 0-∞ by 251%  and C max by 84% , compared to pralsetinib administered alone. 
> Co-administration of pralsetinib  with P -gp and/or strong or moderate  CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase pralsetinib plasma concentrations, which may increase the risk of adverse reactions of pralsetinib. Co -administration of pralsetinib with the following should be a voided  (see section 4.4) :   
• combined P -gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitor s (including, but not limited to, KETOCONAZOLE, ITRACONAZOLE, COBICISTAT, CLARITHROMYCIN, RITONAVIR, or SAQUINAVIR)  
• strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (including, but not limited to, TELITHROMYCIN,  TROLEANDOMYCIN, VORICONAZOLE, CERITINIB, IDELALISIB, NEFAZODONE, NELFINAVIR, or GRAPEFRUIT JUICE)  
• moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (including, but not limited to, APREPITANT, CIPROFLOXACIN, CONIVAPTAN, CRIZOTINIB, FLUCONAZOLE, fluvoxa mine, IMATINIB, ISAVUCONAZOLE, or TOFISOPAM)  
• P-gp inhibitors (including, but not limited to, CYCLOSPORINE, CARVEDILOL or QUINIDINE)  
• combined P -gp and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (including, but not limited to, DRONEDARONE, DILTIAZEM, ERYTHROMYCIN, VERAPAMIL) 
> Strong CYP3A4 inducers  Co-administration of pralsetinib with strong C YP3A4 inducers can decrease pralsetinib plasma concentrations, which may decrease the efficacy of pralsetinib. Co -administration of 400 mg pralsetinib as a single dose with RIFAMPIN  600 mg once daily (a strong CYP3A4 inducer) decreased pralsetinib AUC 0-∞ by 68%  and C max by 30% . Therefore, c o-administration of pralsetinib  with strong CYP3A4 inducers  (including, but not limited to, CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENYTOIN, RIFABUTIN, rifampicin and St. John’s Wort [ Hypericum perforatum ]) should be avoided (see section 4.4) .
> Sensitive substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, P -gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, MATE1 and MATE2 -K with narrow therapeutic index  Co-administration of pralsetinib can alter the exposure of sensitive substrates of CYP ENZYMES (CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and CYP2C8) and transporters (P -gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, MATE1 and MATE2 -K). Substrate drugs of these CYP ENZYMES and transporters with narrow therapeutic index (including, but not limited to CYCLOSPORINE, PACLITAXEL and WARFARIN) should be avoided.
