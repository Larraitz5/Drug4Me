> VAXELIS may be administered simultaneously with pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate VACCINES,rotavirus VACCINES, measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) and varicella containing VACCINES
,meningococcal
 B and C conjugate VACCINES.Data from a clinical study indicate that, when VAXELIS is co
-administered with pneumococcalconjugate vaccine (PCV13), the rate of fever is higher f ollowing the booster dose in the second year oflife compared to the primary series. Almost all fevers were mild or moderate (<39.5°C) and transient(duration of 
≤2 days) ( see section  4.8).Co-administration of
 VAXELIS with other injectable VACCINES must be carried out at separate injection6sites and, pref erably, separate limbs.VAXELIS should not be mixed with any other vaccine or other parenterally administered medicinalproducts.Immunosuppressive therapy may interfere with the development of expected immune response (seesection  4.4).Due to an increased risk of fever, tenderness at the injection site, change in eating habits andirritability when a dif ferent hexavalent vaccine with a similar reactogenicity prof ile to VAXELIS was co
-administered with Meningococcal B vaccine, separate vaccinations can be considered.
