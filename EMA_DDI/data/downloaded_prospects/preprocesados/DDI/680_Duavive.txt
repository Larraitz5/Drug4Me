> The metabolism of oestrogens may be increased by concomitant use of substances known to induce drug-metabolising ENZYMES, such as anticonvulsants (e.g., PHENOBARBITAL, PHENYTOIN, CARBAMAZEPINE) and anti-infectives (e.g., rifampicin, RIFABUTIN, NEVIRAPINE, EFAVIRENZ). RITONAVIR and NELFINAVIR, although known as strong inhibitors, by contrast exhibit inducing properties when used concomitantly with steroid hormones. Herbal preparations containing St Johnâ€™s wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) may induce the metabolism of oestrogens. Clinically, an increased metabolism of oestrogens may lead to decreased effect and changes in the uterine bleeding profile.
> The metabolism of BAZEDOXIFENE may be increased by concomitant use of substances known to induce URIDINE diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), such as rifampicin, PHENOBARBITAL, CARBAMAZEPINE, and PHENYTOIN, potentially leading to decreased systemic concentrations of 8 BAZEDOXIFENE. A reduction in BAZEDOXIFENE exposure may be associated with an increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia (see section 4.4).
