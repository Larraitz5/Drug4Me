> As in adults, there is no evidence of clinically significant medicinal product interactions in paediatric patients receiving up to 60  mg/kg/day levetiracetam.  8 A retrospective assessment of pharmacokinetic interactions in children and adolescents with epilepsy (4 to 17 years) confirmed that adjunctive therapy with orally administered levetiracetam did not influence the steady -state serum concentrations of concomitantly administered CARBAMAZEPINE and valproate. However, data suggested a 2 0 % higher levetiracetam clearance in children taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic medicinal products. Dose adjustment is not required. 
> Concomitant administration of levetiracetam and METHOTREXATE has been reported to decrease METHOTREXATE clearance, resulting in increased/prolonged blood METHOTREXATE concentration to potentially toxic levels. Blood METHOTREXATE and levetiracetam levels should be carefully monitored in patients treated co ncomitantly with the two drugs. 
> Levetiracetam 1000  mg daily did not influence the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives (ethinylestradiol and LEVONORGESTREL); endocrine parameters (luteinizing hormone and PROGESTERONE) were not m odified. Levetiracetam 2000  mg daily did not influence the pharmacokinetics of DIGOXIN and WARFARIN; prothrombin times were not modified. Co-administration with DIGOXIN, oral contraceptives and WARFARIN did not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracet am.
