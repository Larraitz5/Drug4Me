> DAPAGLIFLOZIN may add to the diuretic effect of thiazide and LOOP DIURETICS and may increase the risk of dehydration and hypotension (see section 4.4).Insulin and insulin secretagogues
> Insulin and insulin secretagogues, such as sulphonylureas, cause hypoglycaemia. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or an insulin secretagogue may be required to r educe the risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with DAPAGLIFLOZIN in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (see sections 4.2 and 
4.8).Pharmacokinetic interactions
> Interaction studies conducted in healthy subjects, using mainly a single -dose design , suggest that the pharmacokinetics of DAPAGLIFLOZIN are not altered by METFORMIN, PIOGLITAZONE, SITAGLIPTIN, GLIMEPIRIDE, VOGLIBOSE, HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE, BUMETANIDE, VALSARTAN, or SIMVASTATIN.Following coadministration of DAPAGLIFLOZIN with rifampicin ( an inducer of VARIOUS active transporters and drug -metabolising ENZYMES) a 22% decrease in DAPAGLIFLOZIN systemic exposure (AUC) was observed, but with no clinically meaningful effect on 24 -hour urinary GLUCOSE excretion. No dose adjustment is recommended. A clinically relevant effect with other inducers (e.g. CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENYTOIN, PHENOBARBITAL) is not expected.Following coadministration of DAPAGLIFLOZIN with MEFENAMIC ACID (an inhibitor of UGT1A9), a 55% increase in DAPAGLIFLOZIN systemic exposure w as seen, but with no clinically meaningful effect on 
24-hour urinary GLUCOSE excretion. No dose adjustment is recommended.Effect of DAPAGLIFLOZIN on other medicinal products
> DAPAGLIFLOZIN may increase renal LITHIUM excretion and the blood LITHIUM levels may be decreased. Serum concentration of LITHIUM should be monitored more frequently after DAPAGLIFLOZIN initiation and dose changes. Please refer the patient to the LITHIUM prescribing doctor in order to monitor serum concentration of LITHIUM.In intera ction studies conducted in healthy subjects, using mainly a single -dose design, DAPAGLIFLOZIN did not alter the pharmacokinetics of METFORMIN, PIOGLITAZONE, SITAGLIPTIN, GLIMEPIRIDE, HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE, BUMETANIDE, VALSARTAN, DIGOXIN (a P -gp substrate) or WARFARIN (S -WARFARIN, a CYP2C9 substrate), or the anticoagulatory effects of WARFARIN as measured by INR. Combination of a single dose of DAPAGLIFLOZIN 20 mg and SIMVASTATIN (a CYP3A4 substrate) resulted in a 19% increase in AUC of SIMVASTATIN and 31% inc rease in AUC of SIMVASTATIN acid. The increase in SIMVASTATIN and SIMVASTATIN acid exposures are not considered clinically relevant .Interference with 1,5 -anhydroglucitol (1,5 -AG) assay
