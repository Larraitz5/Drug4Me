>  Lacosamide shou ld be used with caution in patients treated with medicinal products known to be associated with PR prolongation ( including sodium channel blocking antiepileptic  medicinal products ) and in patients treated with antiarrhythmic s. However, subgroup analysis  in clinical studies  did not identify an increased magnitude of PR prolongation in patients with concomitant administration of CARBAMAZEPINE or LAMOTRIGINE. 
> Lacosamide  does not inhibit or induce CYP2C19 and CYP 3A4 to a clinically relevant extent. Lacosamide did not affect the AUC of MIDAZOLAM (metabolised by CYP3A4, lacosamide given 200 mg twice a day ), but C max of MIDAZOLAM was slightly increased (30  %). Lacosamide did  not affect the pharmacokinetics of OMEPRAZOLE (metabolised by CYP2C19 and CYP 3A4, lacosamide given 300 mg twice a day ).  The CYP2C19 inhibitor OMEPRAZOLE (40 mg once daily ) did not give rise to a clinically significant change in lacosamide exposure.  Thus , moderate i nhibitors of CYP2C19 are unlikely to affect systemic lacosamide exposure to a clinically relevant extent.   Caution is recommended in concomitant treatment with strong inhibitors of CYP2C9 (e.g.  FLUCONAZOLE) and CYP3A4 (e.g.  ITRACONAZOLE, KETOCONAZOLE, RITONAVIR, CLARITHROMYCIN), which may lead to increased systemic exposure of lacosamide. Such interactions have not been established in vivo , but are possible based on in vitro  data. 
> In interaction studies  lacosamide did not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of CARBAMAZEPINE and VALPROIC ACID. Lacosamide plasma concentrations were not affected by CARBAMAZEPINE and by VALPROIC ACID. Population pharmacokinetic  analyses in different age groups  estimated that concomitant treatment with other antiepileptic medicinal products  known to be enzyme inducers (CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENYTOIN, PHENOBARBITAL, in VARIOUS doses) decreased the overall systemic exposure of lacosamide by 25  % in adults and 17  % in paediat ric patients . 
> Interaction studies  showed that lacosamide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of DIGOXIN. There was no clinically relevant interaction between lacosamide and METFORMIN.  Co-administration of WARFARIN with lacosami de does not result in a clinically relevant change in the  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of WARFARIN.
