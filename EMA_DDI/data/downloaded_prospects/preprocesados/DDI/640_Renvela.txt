> CIPROFLOXACIN  In interaction studies in healthy volunteers, SEVELAMER hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as SEVELAMER CARBONATE , decreased the bioavailability of CIPROFLOXACIN by approximately 50% when co-administered with SEVELAMER hydrochloride in a single dose study. Consequently, SEVELAMER CARBONATE should not be taken simultaneously with CIPROFLOXACIN.
> CICLOSPORIN, mycophenola te mofetil and TACROLIMUS in transplant patients  Reduced levels of CICLOSPORIN, MYCOPHENOLATE MOFETIL and TACROLIMUS  have been reported in transplant patients when co -administered with SEVELAMER hydrochloride without any clinical consequences ( e.g., graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded and a close monitoring of blood concentrations of CICLOSPORIN, MYCOPHENOLATE MOFETIL and TACROLIMUS  should be considered during the use of combination and after its withdrawal. 
> PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS During post -marketing experience, very rare cases of increased phosphate levels have been reported in patients taking PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS co- administered with SEVELAMER carb onate.  Caution should be exercised when prescribing PPI to patients concomitantly treated with RENVELA. The phosphate serum level should be monitored and the R envela dosage adjusted consequently .
