> Potent enzymatic inducers such as rifampicin, PHENOBARBITAL and PHENYTOIN may via the ir action on UDP -glucuronyltransferases slightly decrease the plasma concentrations of abacavir. 
> ETHANOL:  the metabolism of abacavir is altered by concomitant ETHANOL resulting in an increase in AUC of abacavir of about 41%. These findings are not considered clinically significant. Abacavir has no effect on the metabolism of ETHANOL. 
> METHADONE : in a pharmacokinetic study, co- administration of 600 mg abacavir twice daily with METHADONE showed a 35% reduction in abacavir Cmax and a one hour delay in t max but the AUC was unchanged. The changes in abacavir pharmacokinetics are not considered clinically relevant. In this study abacavir increased the mean METHADONE systemic clearance by 22%. The induction of drug metabolising ENZYMES cannot therefore be exclud ed. Patients being treated with METHADONE and abacavir should be monitored for evidence of withdrawal symptoms indicating under dosing, as occasionally METHADONE re- titration may be required.  7  Retinoids:  retinoid compounds are eliminated via alcohol dehydrogenase. Interaction with abacavir is possible but has not been studied. 
> RIOCIGUAT:  In vitro, abacavir inhibits CYP1A1. Concomitant administration of a single dose of RIOCIGUAT (0.5 mg) to HIV patients receiving the combination of abacavir/DOLUTEGRAVIR/l amivudine (600mg/50mg/300mg once daily) led to an approximately three -fold higher RIOCIGUAT AUC(0- ∞) when compared to historical RIOCIGUAT AUC(0- ∞) reported in healthy subjects. RIOCIGUAT dose may need to be reduced . Consult the RIOCIGUAT prescribing infor mation  for dosing recommendations.
