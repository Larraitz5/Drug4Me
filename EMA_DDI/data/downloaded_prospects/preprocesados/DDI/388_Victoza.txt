> No interaction study has been performed. A clinically relevant interaction with active substances with poor solubility or with narrow therapeutic index such as WARFARIN cannot be excluded. Upon initiation of liraglutide  treatment in patients on WARFARIN or  other COUMARIN derivatives , more frequent monitoring of INR (International Normalised Ratio) is recommended. 
> Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure of ATORVASTATIN to a clinical ly relevant degree following single dose administration of ATORVASTATIN 40 mg. Therefore, no dose adjustment of ATORVASTATIN is required when given with liraglutide. ATORVASTATIN C max was decreased by 38% and median t max was delayed from 1 h to 3  h with liraglutide. 
> Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure of GRISEOFULVIN following administration of a single dose of GRISEOFULVIN 500 mg. GRISEOFULVIN C max increased by 37% while median t max did not change. Dose adjustments of GRISEOFULVIN and other compounds with low solubility and high permeability are not required. 
> A single dose administration of DIGOXIN 1 mg with liraglutide resulted in a reduction of DIGOXIN AUC by 16%;  Cmax decreased by 31%. DIGOXIN median t max was delayed from 1  h to 1.5 h.  No adjustment of DIGOXIN dose is required based on these results. 
> A single dose administration of LISINOPRIL 20 mg with liraglutide resulted in a reduction of LISINOPRIL AUC by 15%; Cmax decreased by 27%. LISINOPRIL median t max was delayed from 6  h to 8 h with liraglutide. No dose adjustment of LISINOPRIL is required based on these results.
> Liraglutide lowered ethinyloestradiol and LEVONORGESTREL C max by 12 and 13%, respectively, following administration of a single dose of an oral contraceptive product. T max was delayed by 1.5  h with liraglutide for both compounds. There was no clinically relevant effect on the overall exposure of either ethinyloestradiol or LEVONORGESTREL. The contraceptive effect is therefore anticipated to be unaffected when co -administered with liraglutide.
