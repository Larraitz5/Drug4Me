> In vitro  data indicate that eribulin is a mild inhibitor of the important drug metabolising enzyme CYP3A4. No in vivo  data are available. Caution and monitoring  for adverse events is recommended with concomitant use of substances that have a narrow therapeutic window and that are eliminated mainly via CYP3A4 -mediated metabolism ( e.g. ALFENTANIL, CYCLOSPORINE, ERGOTAMINE, FENTANYL, PIMOZIDE, QUINIDINE, SIROLIMUS, TACROLIMUS ).
