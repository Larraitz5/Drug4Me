> Table 1 : Interactions  Concomitant medicinal product by therapeutic area  Effect on concentration of temsavir or c oncomitant medicinal product  Recommendation  concerning c o-administration  HIV -1 Antiviral Agents  Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor  EFAVIRENZ (EFV)  Temsavir ↓ (induction of CYP3A ENZYMES)1   This interaction has not been studied.  EFAVIRENZ is expected to decrease temsavir plasma concentrations. No dose adjustment is necessary .  ETRAVIRINE (ETR) without boosted PROTEASE INHIBITORS  Temsavir ↓
> ETR ↔ ETRAVIRINE decreased temsavir plasma concentrations. N o dose adjustment of either medicinal product  is necessary.  NEVIRAPINE (NVP)  Temsavir ↓ (induction of CYP3A ENZYMES)1   This interaction has not been studied.  NEVIRAPINE is expected to decrease temsavir plasma concentrations. N o dose adjustment is necessary . Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor  TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL  (TDF)  Temsavir ↔
>  Cτ ↑ 28% No dose adjustment of either medicinal product  is necessary.  6 TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE (TAF)  TAF ↑ (inhibition of OATP1B1/3 and/or BCRP )    This interaction has not been studied.  Temsavir is expected to increase TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE plasma concentrations. T he recommended dose of TAF is 10 mg when co-administered with fostemsavir . Protease Inhibitor  ATAZANAVIR (ATV)/RITONAVIR (RTV)  Temsavir ↑
> ATV ↔  RTV ↔ ATAZANAVIR/RITONAVIR increased temsavir concentrations. No dose adjustment of either medicinal product is necessary.  DARUNAVIR (DRV)/COBICISTAT  Temsavir ↑
>  Cτ ↑ 124%  (inhibition of CYP3A ENZYMES, P -gp and/or BCRP)1   DARUNAVIR/COBICISTAT increased temsavir plasma concentrations. No dose adjustment is necessary.  DARUNAVIR (DRV)/RITONAVIR  Temsavir ↑
>  Cτ ↑ 19% DARUNAVIR/RITONAVIR increased temsavir plasma concentrations. No dose adjustment is necessary  for any medicinal product  when co -administered . DARUNAVIR (DRV)/RITONAVIR 
+ ETRAVIRINE  Temsavir ↑
> ETRAVIRINE ↔ DARUNAVIR/RITONAVIR co -administered with ETRAVIRINE increased temsavir plasma concentrations. No dose adjustment is necessary  for any medicinal product  when co -administered . 7   AUC ↑ 28%
>  Cτ ↑ 136%  (inhibition of CYP3A ENZYMES, P -gp and/or BCRP)1 COBICISTAT increased temsavir plasma concentrations. No dose adjustment is necessary.  RITONAVIR  Temsavir ↑
> RTV ↔ RITONAVIR increased temsavir plasma concentrations. No dose adjustment of either medicinal product is necessary.  Others  MARAVIROC  (MVC)  Temsavir ↔
>  Cτ ↓ 41%  (induction of CYP3A ENZYMES)1   RIFABUTIN decreased temsavir plasma concentrations. No dose adjustment is necessary.  RIFABUTIN + RITONAVIR  Temsavir ↑
>  Cτ ↑ 158%  RIFABUTIN co -administered with RITONAVIR increased temsavir plasma concentrations. No dose adjustment is necessary.  Rifampicin  
>  Cmax ↓ 76%  (induction of CYP3A ENZYMES)   Rifampicin co -administration may lead to loss of virologic response to fostemsavir due to significant decreases in temsavir plasma concentrations caused by strong CYP3A4 induction. Therefore, the concomitant use of fostemsavir and rifampicin  is contraindicated .
> Although not studied, concomitant use of fostemsavir and other strong CYP3A4 inducers is contraindicated (see section 4.3) .  HMG CO -A Reductase Inhibitors:  ROSUVASTATIN  ATORVASTATIN  PITAVASTATIN   FLUVASTATIN  SIMVASTATIN 
> Coadministration of fostemsavir increases  ROSUVASTATIN plasma concentrations  caused by OATP1B1/3 and/ or BCRP  inhibition by temsavir . Therefore u se the lowest possible starting dose of ROSUVASTATIN with careful monitoring. 
> Although not studied, c linically relevant increases in plasma concentrations of PRAVASTATIN are not expected as it is not a substrate o f BCRP. No dose adjustment is requir ed. 9 Hepatitis C virus Direct -Acting ANTIVIRALS (HCV DAAs) : ELBASVIR/GRAZOPREVIR 
> HCV- DAA ↑  This interaction has not been studied.  Temsavir may increase GRAZOPREVIR plasma concentrations to a clinically relevant extent  caused by OATP1B1/3 inhibition by temsavir. Co-administration of fostemsavir with ELBASVIR/GRAZOPREVIR is not recommended  as increased GRAZOPREVIR concent rations may increase the risk of ALT elevations.
