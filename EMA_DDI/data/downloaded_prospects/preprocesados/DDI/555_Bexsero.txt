> BEXSERO can be given concomitantly with any of the following vaccine antigens, either as monovalent or as combination VACCINES: diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae  type b, inactivated poliomyelitis, hepatitis B, heptavalent pneumococca l conjugate, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella , and meningococcal groups A,  C, W, Y  conjugate .
> Clinical studies demonstrated that the immune responses of the co -administered routine VACCINES were unaffected by concomitant administration of BEXSERO , based  on non- inferior antibody response rates to the routine VACCINES given alone. Inconsistent results were seen across studies for responses to inactivated poliovirus type  2 and pneumococcal conjugate serotype  6B and lower antibody titers to the pertussis pertactin antigen were also noted, but these data do not suggest clinically significant interference. 
> Due to an increased risk of fever, tenderness at the injection site, change in eating habits and irritability  when BEXSERO was co -administered with the above VACCINES, separate vaccinations can be considered whe n possible . Prophylactic use of paracetamol  reduces the incidence and severity of fever without affecting the immunogenicity of either BEXSERO or routine VACCINES. The effect of antipyretics other than paracetamol on the immune response has not been studied. 
> Concomitant administration of BEXSERO with VACCINES other than those mentioned above has not been studied.
