> Erythropoietic agents, or other agents that may increase the risk of thrombosis, such as hormone replacement therapy, should be used with caution in multiple myeloma patients receiving lenalidomide with DEXAMETHASONE (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).
> Co-administration of multiple  10 mg  doses of lenalidomide had no effect on the single dose pharmacokinetics of R- and S- WARFARIN. Co-administration of a single 25 mg dose of WARFARIN had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide. However, it is not known whether there is an interac tion during clinical use (concomitant treatment with DEXAMETHASONE). DEXAMETHASONE is a weak to moderate enzyme inducer and its effect on WARFARIN is unknown. Close monitoring of WARFARIN concentration is advised during the treatment. 
> Concomitant administration with lenalidomide 10  mg once daily  increased the plasma exposure of DIGOXIN (0.5 mg, single dose) by 14 % with a 90 % CI (confidence interval) [0.52  %-28.2 %]. It is not known whether the effect will be different in the clinical use (higher lenalidomide doses and concomitant treatment with DEXAMETHASONE). Therefore, monitoring of the DIGOXIN concentration is advised during lenalidomide treatment.  Statins 
> Co-administration of single or multiple doses of DEXAMETHASONE (40 mg  once daily ) has no clinically relevant effect on the multiple dose pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide (25 mg  once daily ).
