> Due to the risk of serotonin syndrome, duloxetine should not be used in combination with non -selective irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), or within at least 14  days of discontinuing treatment with an MAOI.  Based on the half -life of duloxetine, at  least 5  days should be allowed after stopping DULOXETINE MYLAN before starting an MAOI (see section  4.3).
> The concomitant use of DULOXETINE MYLAN with selective, reversible MAOIs, like MOCLOBEMIDE, is not recommended (see section  4.4).  The antibiotic li nezolid is a reversible non -selective MAOI and should not be given to patients treated with DULOXETINE MYLAN (see section  4.4).
> Because CYP1A2 is involved in duloxetine metabolism, concomitant use of duloxetine with potent inhibitors of CYP1A2 is likely to result in higher concentrations of duloxetine.  FLUVOXAMINE (100  mg once daily), a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2, decreased the apparent plasma clearance of duloxetine by about 77% and increased AUC o-t 6-fold.  Therefore Dulo xetine Mylan should not be administered in combination with potent inhibitors of CYP1A2 like FLUVOXAMINE (see section  4.3).
> The risk of using duloxetine in combination with other CNS -active medicinal products has not been systemati cally evaluated, except in the cases described in this section.  Consequently, caution is advised when DULOXETINE MYLAN is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicinal products or substances, including alcohol and sedative medicinal products (e.g. benzodiazepines, morphinomimetics, ANTIPSYCHOTICS, PHENOBARBITAL, sedative antihistamines). 
> Medicinal products metabolised by CYP1A2  The pharmacokinetics of THEOPHYLLINE, a CYP1A2 substrate, were not significantly affected by co-administration with duloxetine (60  mg twice daily). 
> Medicinal products metabolised by CYP2D6  Duloxetine is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6. When duloxetine was administered at a dose o f 60 mg twice daily with a single dose of DESIPRAMINE, a CYP2D6 substrate, the AUC of DESIPRAMINE increased 
3-fold.  The co -administration of duloxetine (40  mg twice daily) increases steady state AUC of TOLTERODINE (2 mg twice daily) by 71%, but does not a ffect the pharmacokinetics of its active 5 -hydroxyl metabolite and no dosage adjustment is recommended.  Caution is advised if DULOXETINE MYLAN is co -administered with medicinal products that are predominantly metabolised by CYP2D6 (RISPERIDONE, tricyclic ANTIDEPRESSANTS [TCAs] such as NORTRIPTYLINE, AMITRIPTYLINE, and IMIPRAMINE) particularly if they have a narrow therapeutic index (such as FLECAINIDE, PROPAFENONE and METOPROLOL). 
> Anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents  Caution should be exercised when duloxetine is combined with or al anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents due to a potential increased risk of bleeding attributable to a pharmacodynamic interaction.  Furthermore, increases in INR values have been reported when duloxetine was co -administered to patients treated with WARFARIN.  However, concomitant administration of duloxetine with WARFARIN under steady state conditions, in healthy volunteers, as part of a clinical pharmacology study, did not result in a clinically significant change in INR from baseline or in the pharmaco kinetics of R - or S-WARFARIN. 
> ANTACIDS and H 2 antagonists  Co-administration of duloxetine with ALUMINIUM - and MAGNESIUM -containing ANTACIDS or duloxetine with FAMOTIDINE had no significant effect on the rate or extent of duloxetine absorption after administration of a 
40 mg oral dose.
