> In a Phase 1 study in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, changes in systemic exposures (Cmaxand AUC inf) of MIDAZOLAM, S -WARFARIN, om eprazole, DEXTROMETHORPHAN, and CAFFEINE after a single dose of guselkumab were not clinically relevant , indicating that interactions between guselkumab and substrates of VARIOUS CYP ENZYMES (CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2) are unlikely. There is no need for dose adjustment when co -administering guselkumab and CYP450 substrates.Concomitant immunosuppressive therapy or phototherapy
> In psoriasis studies , the safety and efficacy of guselkumab in combination with IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS, including bi ologics, or phototherapy have not been evaluated.5
