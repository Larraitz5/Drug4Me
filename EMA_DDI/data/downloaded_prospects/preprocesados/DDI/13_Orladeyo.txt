> P-gp and BCRP inhibitors CYCLOSPORINE, a P -gp and BCRP inhibitor, increased the steady state maximum concentration (C max) of berotralstat by 25% and the AUC of berotralstat by 55%. Berotralstat exposure may be increased with concomitant administration of P -gp and BCRP inhibitors, but no dose adjustme nt is necessary.  Close monitoring for adverse events  is recommended for concomi tant use with P -gp and BCRP inhibitors.
> CYP3A4 substrates Berotrals tat is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4, increasing the Cmax and AUC of oral MIDAZOLAM by 
45% and  124%, respectively, and the C max and AUC of AMLODIPINE by 45% and  77%, respectively. Concomitant administration may increase concentrations of other medic ines that are CYP3A4 substrates. Refer to the Sm
> PC  for concomitant medicines that are predominantly metabolised by CYP3A4, particularly those with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. CYCLOSPORINE, FENTANYL) . Dose adjustments of these medicines may be required (see section 5.2).
> CYP2D6 substrates Berotralstat is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6, increasing the C max and AUC of DEXTROMETHORPHAN by 
196% and 177%, respectively, and the C max and AUC of DESIPRAMINE by 64% and 87%, respectively. Concomitant administration may increase exposure of other medicines that are CYP2D6 substrates. Refer to the Sm
> PC  for concomitant medicines that are predominantly metabolised by CYP2D6, particularly tho se with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. THIORIDAZINE, PIMOZIDE) or whose prescribing information recommends therapeutic monitoring (e.g. tricyclic ANTIDEPRESSANTS) . Dose adjustments of these medicines may be required  (see section 5.2 ).
> CYP2C9 substrates Berotralstat is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9 increasing the Cmax and AUC of TOLBUTAMIDE by 19% and 
73%, respectively. No dose adjustment is recommended for concomitant use of medicines that are predominantly metabolised by CYP2C9 (e.g. TOLBUTAMIDE) (s ee sect ion 5.2).
> The effect of berotralstat on the CYP2C9 conversion of DESOGESTREL to ETONOGESTREL (active metabolite) was negligible. No dose adjustment is recommended for concomitant use of DESOGESTREL. 
> CYP2C19 substrates Berotralstat is not an inhibitor of CYP2C19, as Cmax and AUC  of OMEPRAZOLE were increased by only 
21% and 24%, respectively. No dose adjustment is recommended for concomitant use of medicines that are predominantly metabolised by CYP2C19 (e.g. OMEPRAZOLE) (see section 5.2).
> P-gp substrates Berotralstat is a weak inhibitor of P -gp and increased the C max and AUC of the P- gp substrate DIGOXIN by 58% and 48% , respectively . Refer to the Sm
> PC for concomitant medicines that are P -gp substrates, particularly those with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. DIGOXIN) or whose prescribing infor mation recommends therapeutic monitoring (e.g. DABIGATRAN) . Dose adjustments of these medicines may be required  (see section 5.2).
> Oral contraceptives  As a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4, berotralstat may increase concentrations of oral contraceptives metabolised by CYP3A4. The coadministration of berotralstat with DESOGESTREL increased the AUC of ETONOGESTREL (active metabolite) by 58%, Cmax was not affected. The effect of berotralstat on the 5 CYP2C9 c onversion of DESOGESTREL to ETONOGESTREL was negligible. No dose adjustment is recommended for concomitant use of DESOGESTREL .
