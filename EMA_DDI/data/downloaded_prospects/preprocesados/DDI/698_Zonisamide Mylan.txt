> Potential medicinal product interactions affecting zonisamide  In clinical studies co-administration of LAMOTRIGINE had  no app arent effect on zonisamide pharmacokinetics. The combination of zonisamide with other medicinal products that may lead to urolithiasis may enhance  the risk of developing kidney  stones; therefore the concomitant administration of such medicinal products should be avoided.

- Enzyme induc tion: Exposure to zonisamide is lower in epileptic patients receiving CYP3A4-induc ing agents such as  phen ytoin, CARBAMAZEPINE, and  pheno barbitone. These effects are unlikely to be of clinical significance when zonisamide is added to existing therapy; however, chan ges in zonisamide concen trations may occur  if concomitant CYP3A4-induc ing anti-epileptic or other medicinal products are withdrawn, dose  adjusted or introduced, an adjustment of the zonisamide dose may be required. Rifampicin is a potent CYP3A4 inducer. If co-administration is necessary, the patient should be closely monitored and  the dose of zonisamide and o ther CYP3A4 sub strates adjusted as needed.
