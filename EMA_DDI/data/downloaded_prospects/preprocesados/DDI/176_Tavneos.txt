> Co-administration of avacopan with rifampicin, a strong CYP3A4 enzyme inducer, resulted in a decrease in area-under -the-concentration time curve (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of avacopan by approximately 93% and 79%, respectively. Since thi s interaction may result in loss of efficacy of avacopan, the use of strong CYP3A4 enzyme inducers (e.g., CARBAMAZEPINE, ENZALUTAMIDE, MITOTANE, PHENOBARBITAL, PHENYTOIN, rifampicin, and St. Johnâ€™s Wort) with avacopan is to be avoided  (see section  4.4). Patients anticipated to require long- term administration of these medicinal products  are not to be treated with avacopan. If short -term co -administration cannot be avoided in a patient already using avacopan, the patient must be closely monitored for any reoccurrence of disease activity. 
> Exercise caution when using moderate CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., BOSENTAN, EFAVIRENZ, ETRAVIRINE, and MODAFINIL) prescribed as concomitant medicinal product  with avacopan  and car efully evaluate the benefit /risk of avacopan. 
> Co-administration of avacopan with ITRACONAZOLE, a strong CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitor, resulted in an increase in AUC and C max of avacopan by approximately  2.2-fold and 1.9-fold , respectively. Therefore, strong CYP3A4 ENZYME INHIBITORS (e.g., BOCEPREVIR, CLARITHROMYCIN, CONIVAPTAN, INDINAVIR, ITRACONAZOLE, KETOCONAZOLE, LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR, MIBEFRADIL, NEFAZODONE, NELFINAVIR, POSACONAZOLE, RITONAVIR, SAQUINAVIR, telap revir, TELITHROMYCIN, and VORICONAZOLE) should be used with caution in patients who are being treated with avacopan. P atients must be  monitored for potential increase of side effects due to the increased exposure of avacopan. 
> Grapefruit and grapefruit jui ce can increase the concentration of avacopan; therefore, grapefruit and GRAPEFRUIT JUICE  are to be avoided in patients treated with avacopan. 
> Avacopan is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 in  vivo and may increase the plasma exposures of concomitant medici nal products  that are CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., ALFENTANIL, CICLOSPORIN , DIHYDROERGOTAMINE, ERGOTAMINE, FENTANYL, SIROLIMUS and TACROLIMUS). Be cautious when these medicinal products are used with avacopan. P atients  must be managed according to the summary of product characteristics of the respective medicin al products  with a narrow therapeutic index.
