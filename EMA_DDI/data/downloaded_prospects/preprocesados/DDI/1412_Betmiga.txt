> Effect of ENZYME INHIBITORS  Mirabegron exposure (AUC) was increased 1.8 -fold in the presence of the strong inhibitor of CYP3A/P -gp KETOCONAZOLE  in healthy volunteers. No dose -adjustment is needed when BETMIGA is combined with  inhibitors of CYP3A and/or P -gp. However, in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment  (GFR 30  to 89 m
> Effect of mirabegron on CYP2D6 substrates  In healthy volunteers, the inhibitory potency of mirabegron towards CYP2D6 is moderate and the CYP2D6 activity recovers within 15  days after discontinuation of mirabegron. Multiple once daily dosing of mirabegron IR resulted in a 90% increase in C max and a 229% increase in AUC of a single dose of METOPROLOL. Multiple once daily dosing of mirabegron resulted in a 79% increase in C max and a 
241% increase in AUC of a single dose of DESIPRAMINE .
> Effect of mirabegron on transporters  Mirabegron is a weak inhibitor of P -gp. Mirabegron increased C max and AUC by 29% and 27%, respectively, of the P -gp substrate DIGOXIN  in healthy volunteers. For patients who are initiating a combination of mirabegron  and DIGOXIN, the lowest dose for DIGOXIN should be prescribed initially. Serum DIGOXIN concentrations should be monitored and used for titration of the DIGOXIN  dose to obta in the desired clinical effect. The potential for inhibition of P -gp by mirabegron should be considered when BETMIGA is combined with sensitive P -gp substrates e.g. DABIGATRAN.
