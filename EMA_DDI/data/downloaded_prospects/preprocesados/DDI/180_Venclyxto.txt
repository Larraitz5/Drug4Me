> Co-administration of 400  mg once daily KETOCONAZOLE, a strong CYP3A, P -gp and BCRP inhibitor, for 
7 days in 11 patients increased venetoclax C max to 2.3-fold and AUC to 6.4-fold. Co-administration of 
50 mg once daily RITONAVIR, a strong CYP3A  and P-gp inhibitor, for 14 days in 6 healthy subjects increased venetoclax C max to 2.4-fold and AUC by 7.9-fold. Compared with venetoclax 400  mg administered alone, co -administration of 300  mg POSACONAZOLE, a strong CYP3A and P -gp inhibitor, with venetoclax 50 mg and 100 mg for 7 days in 12 patients increased venetoclax C max to 1.6-fold and 12 1.9-fold, and AUC to 1.9-fold and 2.4-fold, respectively. Co-administration of venetoclax with other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is predicted to increase venetoclax AUC by on average 5.8- to 7.8-fold.  
> Co-administration of 600 mg once daily rifampi cin, a strong CYP3A inducer, for 13  days in 10 healthy subjects decreased venetoclax C max by 42% and AUC by 71%. Concomitant use of venetoclax with strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENYTOIN, rifampi cin) or moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g., BOSENTAN, EFAVIRENZ, ETRAVIRINE, MODAFINIL, NAFCILLIN)  should be avoided. Alternative treatments with less CYP3A induction should be considered. Preparations containing ST. JOHN'S WORT are contraindicated during treatment with venetoclax, as efficacy may be reduced (see section 4.3). 
> In a drug-drug interaction study in 12 healthy subjects, c o-administration of 500  mg of AZITHROMYCIN on the first day followed by 250  mg of AZITHROMYCIN once daily for 4 days decreased venetoclax C max by 25% and AUC by 35%. No dose adjustment is needed during short-term use of AZITHROMYCIN when administered concomitantly with venetoclax.
> In a drug-drug interaction study in three healthy volunteers, administration of a single dose of 400  mg venetoclax with 5 mg WARFARIN resulted in an 18% to 28% increase in C max and AUC of R-WARFARIN and S-WARFARIN. Because venetoclax was not dosed to steady state, it is recommended that the international normalized ratio (INR) be monitored closely in patients receiving WARFARIN.  13  Substrates of P-gp, BCRP, and OATP1B1 
> Venetoclax is a P-gp, BCRP and OATP1B1 inhibitor in vitro. In a drug-drug interaction study,  administration of a single 100  mg dose of venetoclax with 0.5 mg DIGOXIN, a P-gp substrate, resulted in a 35% increase in DIGOXIN C max and a 9% increase in DIGOXIN AUC.  Co-administration of narrow therapeutic index P-gp, or BCRP substrates (e.g., DIGOXIN, DABIGATRAN, EVEROLIMUS, SIROLIMUS) with venetoclax should be avoided.
