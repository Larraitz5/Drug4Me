> In interaction studies, raltegravir did not have a clinically meaningful ef f ect on the pharmacokineticsof  ETRAVIRINE, MARAVIROC, tenof ovir  disoproxil fumarate , hormonal contraceptives, METHADONE,midazola m or BOCEPREVIR. In some studies, co
-admi nistration of  raltegravir  with DARUNAVIR resulted in a modest decrease indarunavir plasma concentrations
; the mechanism f or this eff ect is
 unknown. However, the ef f ect ofraltegravir on DARUNAVIR
 plasma concentrations does not appea r to be clinically meaningful.6Effect of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir
> Given that raltegravir
 is metabolised primarily via UGT
1A1, caution should be used whenco-administering raltegr avir with strong inducers of UGT1A1 (e.g
., rifampicin). Rifampicin reducesplasma leve ls of  raltegravir; the impact on the ef f icacy of raltegravir is unknown. However
, ifco-administration with rifampicin is unavoidable,
 a doubling of  the dose of  raltegrav ir can beconside red in adults. There  are no data to guide co-administration of ralteg ravir with rifampicin inpatients below 18
 years of  age (see section  4.4). The i mpact of  other strong inducers of
 drugmetabolizing  ENZYMES, such as PHENYTOIN and PHENOBARBITAL, on UGT1A1
 is unknown . Less po tentinducers (e.g., EFAVIRENZ, NEVIRAPINE, ETRAVIRINE, rif abutin, GLUCOCORTICOIDS, ST. JOHN'S WORT,PIOGLITAZONE) may be used with the recommended dose of ralteg ravir.Co-administra tion of  raltegra vir with medicinal products that are known to be potent U GT1A1inhibitors (e.g.,
 ATAZANAVIR) may increase plasma levels of raltegravir. Less potent UGT1A1 inhibitors(e
.g., INDINAVIR, SAQUINAVIR) may also increase plasma levels of  raltegravir, but to a lesser extentcompared with ATAZANAVIR. In addition, tenof ov ir disoproxil fumarate may increase plasma levels
 ofraltegravir, however, the mechanism f or this effect is unknown (see Table
 1)
. From the clinical trials, alarge proportion of patients used ATAZANAVIR and / or TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL f u marate, both agents thatresult in increases in raltegravir plasma levels, in the optimised background regimens. The safetyprofile observed in patients who used ATAZANAVIR and / or tenof ovir  disoproxil f umarate  was gen erallysimilar to th e safety prof ile of patients who did not use these agents. Theref ore, no dose adjustment isrequired.Co-adminis tration of  raltegravir  with ANTACIDS containing divalent metal cations may reduce raltegravirabsorption by
 chelation, resulting in a decrease of  raltegravir plasma levels. Taking an ALUMINIUM andmagnes ium antacid within 
6 hours  of raltegravir administration signif icantly decreased raltegravirplasma levels
. Theref ore , co-administration of
 raltegravir  with alu minium and/or magnesiumcontaining a ntacids is not recommended. Co-admini stration of  raltegravir  with a CALCIUM carbonateantacid decreased raltegravir plasma levels; however, this interaction is not considered cl inicallymeaningful. Theref ore, when ralteg ravir is co-administered with CALCIUM CARBONATE containingantacids no do se adjustment is requir ed.Co-administration of raltegravir with other agents that increase gastric p
> H (e.g., OMEPRAZOLE andf amotidine) may increase the rate of
 raltegravir absorption and result in
 increased plasma levels ofraltegrav ir (see Table 1). Sa f ety profiles in the subgroup of patients in Phase III trials taking protonpump inhibitors or H2 antagonists were comparable with those who
 were not taking these
 ANTACIDS.Theref ore , no dose adjustment is required with
 use of PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS or H2 antagonists.All inter action studies were perf ormed in adults.Table  1Pharmacokinetic Interaction Data
