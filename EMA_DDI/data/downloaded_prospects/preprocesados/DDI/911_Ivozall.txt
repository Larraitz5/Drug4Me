> Patients who have previously received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) may be at higher risk for hepatotoxicity suggest ive of veno- occlusive disease (VOD) following treatment with clofarabine (40  mg/m
2) when used in combination with ETOPOSIDE (100 mg/m2) and CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE (440 mg/m2). In the post-marketing period, following treatment with clofarabine, serious hepatotoxi c adverse reactions of VOD in paediatric and adult patients have been associated with a fatal outcome. Cases of hepatitis and hepatic failure, including fatal outcomes, have been reported with clofarabine treatment (see section 4.8). 
> Most patients receiv ed conditioning regimens that included BUSULFAN, MELPHALAN, and/or the combination of CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE and total body irradiation. Severe hepatotoxic events have been reported in a Phase 1/2 combination study of clofarabine in paediatric patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukaemia. 
> Medicinal product no longer authorised7 Clofarabine is predominately excreted via the kidneys. Thus, the concomitant use of medicinal products that have been associated with renal toxicity and those eliminated by tubular secretion such as NSAIDs, AMPHOTERICIN B, METHOTREXATE, aminosides, organoplatines, FOSCARNET, PENTAMIDINE, cyclosporin, TACROLIMUS, ACYCLOVIR and VALGANCICLOVIR, should be avoided particularly during the 5 day clofarabine administration period (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.2).
