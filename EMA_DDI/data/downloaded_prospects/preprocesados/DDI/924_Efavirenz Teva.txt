> Efavirenz is an in vivo inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and UGT1A1. Compounds that are substrates of these ENZYMES may have decreased plasma concentrations when co -administered with efavirenz. In vitro efavirenz is also an inhibitor of CYP3A4. Theoretically, efa virenz may therefore initially increase the exposure to CYP3A4 substrates and caution is warranted for CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic index (see section 4. 3). Efavirenz may be an inducer of CYP2C19 and CYP2C9; however inhibition has also been observed in vitro and the net effect of co -administration with substrates of these ENZYMES is not clear (see section  5.2).
> Efavirenz exposure may be increased when given with medicinal products (for example, RITONAVIR) or food (for example, GRAPEFRUIT JUICE ), which inhibit CYP3A4 or CYP2B6 activity. Compounds or herbal preparations (for example Gink go biloba extracts and St. Joh n’s wort) which induce these ENZYMES may give rise to decreased plasma concentrations of e favirenz. Concomitant use of St. John’s wort is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Concomitant use of Gink go biloba extract s is not recommended (see section 4.4). 
> QT Prolonging Drugs  Efavirenz is contraindicated with concomitant use of drugs (they may cause prolonged QTc interval and Torsade de P ointes) such as: antiarrhythmics of classes IA and III, neuroleptics and antidepressant agents, certain ANTIBIOTICS including some agents of the following classes: MACROLIDES, FLUOROQUINOLONES, imidazole, and triazole antifungal agents, certain non-sedatin g antihistaminics (TERFENADINE, ASTEMIZOLE), CISAPRIDE, FLECAINIDE, certain ANTIMALARIALS and METHADONE (see section 4.3). 
> ELBASVIR/GRAZOPREVIR  Concomitant administration of efavirenz with ELBASVIR/GRAZOPREVIR is contraindicated because it may lead to loss of virologic response to ELBASVIR/GRAZOPREVIR. This loss is due to significant decreases in ELBASVIR and GRAZOPREVIR plasma concentrations caused by CYP3A4 induction. (see section 4.3). 
> St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum)  Co-administration of efavirenz and St. John’s wort or herbal preparations containing St. J ohn’s wort is contraindicated. Plasma levels of efavirenz can be reduced by concomitant use of St. John’s wort due to induction of drug-metabolising ENZYMES and/or transport proteins by St. John’s wort. If a patient is  8 already taking St. John’s wort, stop St. John’s wort, check viral levels and if possible efavirenz levels. Efavirenz levels may increase on stopping St. John’s wort and the dose of efavirenz may need adjusting. The inducing effect of St. John’s wort may persist for at least 2 weeks after cessation of treatment (see section 4.3).

When efavirenz is co -administered with a CALCIUM channel blocker that is a substrate of the CYP3A4 enzyme, there is a potential for reduction in the plasma concentrations of the CALCIUM channel blocker.  Dose adjustments of CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS should be guided by clinical response (refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics  for the CALCIUM channel blocker).  LIPID -LOWERING MEDICINAL PRODUCTS  HMG Co
> Total active HMG Co -A reductase  Cholesterol levels should be periodically monito red. Dose adjustment of SIMVASTATIN may be required (refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for SIMVASTATIN). No dose adjustment is necessary for efavirenz.   18 Medicinal product by therapeutic areas (dose)  Effects on drug levels  Mean percent change in AUC, Cmax, C min with confidence intervals if availablea (mechanism)  Recommendation concerning co-administration with efavirenz inhibitors:  AUC: ↓ 60% ( ↓ 52 to ↓ 68) Cmax: ↓ 62% ( ↓ 55 to ↓ 78)
> (CYP3A4 induction)  Co-administration of efavirenz with ATORVASTATIN, PRAVASTATIN, or SIMVASTATIN did not affect efavirenz AUC or C max values.  ROSUVASTATIN/efavirenz  Interaction not studied. ROSUVASTATIN is largely excreted unchange d via the faeces, therefore interaction with efavirenz is not expected.  No dose adjustment is necessary for either medicinal product.  HORMONAL CONTRACEPTIVES  Oral:  Ethinyloestradiol + NORGESTIMATE / efavirenz  (0.035  mg + 0.25  mg once  daily/600  mg once daily)  Ethinyloestradiol:  AUC: ↔  Cmax: ↔ Cmin: ↓ 8% (↑ 14 to ↓ 25) 
> Efavirenz: no clinically significant interaction.  The clinical significance of these effects is not known.  A reliable method of barrier contraception must be used in addition to hormo nal contraceptives (see section 4.6).  Injection: Depomedroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA)/efavirenz  (150 mg IM single dose DMPA)  In a 3 -month drug interaction study, no significant differences in MPA pharmacokinetic parameters were found between subjects re ceiving efavirenz -containing antiretroviral therapy and subjects receiving no antiretroviral therapy. Similar results were found by other investigators, although the MPA plasma levels were more variable in the second study. In both studies, plasma progeste rone levels for subjects receiving efavirenz and DMPA remained low consistent with suppression of ovulation.  Because of the limited information available, a reliable method of barrier contraception must be used in addition to hormonal contraceptives (see section 4.6).  Implant: ETONOGESTREL/efavirenz  Decreased exposure of ETONOGESTREL may be expected (CYP3A4 induction). There have been occasional postmarketing reports of contraceptive failure with ETONOGESTREL in efavirenz -exposed patients.  A reliable metho d of barrier contraception must be used in addition to hormonal contraceptives (see section 4.6).   19 Medicinal product by therapeutic areas (dose)  Effects on drug levels  Mean percent change in AUC, Cmax, C min with confidence intervals if availablea (mechanism)  Recommendation concerning co-administration with efavirenz IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS  IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g. c yclosporin e, TACROLIMUS, SIROLIMUS)/efavirenz  Interaction not studied. Decreased exposure  of the immunosuppressant may be expected (CYP3A4 induction). These IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS are not anticipated to affect exposure of efavirenz.  Dose adjustments of the immunosuppressant may be required. Close monitoring of immunosuppressant concentrations for at least 2  weeks (until stable concentrations are reached) is recommended when starting or stopping treatment with efavirenz.  NON -OPIOID ANALGESICS  METAMIZOLE/efavirenz  Co-administration of efavirenz with METAMIZOLE, which is an inducer of metabolising ENZYMES including CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 may cause a reduction in plasma concentrations of efavirenz with potential decrease in clinical efficacy.  Therefore, caution is advised  when METAMIZOLE and efavirenz.  are administered concurrently;  clinical response and/or drug  levels should be monitored as  appropriate.  OPIOIDS  METHADONE/efavirenz  (stable maintenance, 35 -100 mg once daily/600  mg once daily)  METHADONE:  AUC: ↓ 52% ( ↓ 33 to ↓ 66) Cmax: ↓ 45% ( ↓ 25 to ↓ 59) (CYP3A4 induction) 
> In a study of HIV infected  intravenous drug users, co-administration of efavirenz with METHADONE resulted in decreased plasma levels of METHADONE and signs of opiate withdrawal. The METHADONE dose was increased by a mean of 22% to alleviate withdrawal symptoms.  Concomitant administ ration with efavirenz should be avoided due to the risk for QTc prolongation (see section 4.3).  BUPRENORPHINE/NALOXONE/ efavirenz  BUPRENORPHINE:  AUC: ↓ 50% 
> Efavirenz:  No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction  Despite the decrease in BUPRENORPHINE exposure, no patients exhibited withdrawal symptoms. Dose adjustment of BUPRENORPHINE or efavirenz may not be necessary when co-administered.  a 90% confidence intervals unless otherwise noted.  b 95% confidence intervals.
