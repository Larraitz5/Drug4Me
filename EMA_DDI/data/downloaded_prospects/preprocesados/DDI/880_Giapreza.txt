> No interaction studies have been performed. No in vitro  metabolism studies have been performed with GIAPREZA.  Patients who have recently received angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may be more sensitive to GIAPREZA’s action with an increased response. Patients who have recently received angiotensin  II receptor blockers (ARB s) may be less sensitive to GIAPREZA’s actions with a reduced response. 
> Concomitant administration of GIAPREZA and other vasopressors may have an additive effect on mean arterial pressure (MAP). The addition of G iapreza  may require a reduction in doses of other vasopressors (e.g. adrenergic  or dopamin ergic age nts).
