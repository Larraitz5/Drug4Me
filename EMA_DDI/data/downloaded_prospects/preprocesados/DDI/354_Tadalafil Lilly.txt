> Cytochrome P450  inhibitors   Tadalafil is principally metabolised by CYP3A4. A selective inhibitor of CYP3A4, KETOCONAZOLE (200 mg daily), increased tadalafil (10  mg) exposure (AUC) 2 -fold and Cmax by 15 %, relative to the  6 AUC and C max values for tadalafil alone. KETOCONAZOLE (400  mg daily) increased tadalafil  (20 mg) exposure (AUC) 4 -fold and C max by 22 %. RITONAVIR, a protease inhibitor (200 mg twice daily), which is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and  CYP2D6, increased tadalafil (20  mg) exposure  (AUC) 2 -fold with no change in C max. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other PROTEASE INHIBITORS, such as SAQUINAVIR, and other C YP3A4  inhibitors, such as ERYTHROMYCIN, CLARITHROMYCIN, ITRACONAZOLE and GRAPEFRUIT JUICE should be co-administered with caution as they would be expected to increase plasma concentrations of tadalafil (see section  4.4).
> Cytochrome P450 inducers  A CYP3A4 inducer, rifampicin, reduced tadalafil AUC by 88  %, relative to the AUC values for tadalafil alone (10  mg). This reduced exposure can be anticipated to decrease the ef ficacy of tadalafil; the magnitude of decreased efficacy is unknown. Other inducers of CYP3A4  such as PHENOBARBITAL, PHENYTOIN and CARBAMAZEPINE, may also decrease plasma concentrations of tadalafil. 
> Anti-hypertensives (including CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS)  The co -administration of DOXAZOSIN (4 and 8 mg daily) and tadalafil (5  mg daily dose and 20 mg as a single dose) increases the blood pressure-loweri ng effect of this alpha -blocker in a significant manner. This effect lasts at least twelve hours and may be symptomatic, including syncope. Therefore this combination is not recommended (see section  4.4).
> In clinical pharmacology studies, the potential for tadalafil to augment the hypotensive effects of antihypertensive medicinal products  was examined. Major classes of antihypertensive medicinal products  were studied, including CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS (AMLODIPINE), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ENALAPRIL), beta -adrenergic receptor blockers (METOPROLOL), thiazide DIURETICS (bendrofluazide), and angiotensin II receptor blockers (VARIOUS t ypes and doses, alone or in combination with thiazides, CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS, beta-blockers, and/or alpha -blockers). Tadalafil (10 mg except for studies with angiotensin II receptor blockers and AMLODIPINE in which a 20  mg dose was applied) had no clin ically significant interaction with any of these classes. In another clinical pharmacology study tadalafil (20 mg) was studied in combination with up to 4 classes of ANTIHYPERTENSIVES. In subjects taking multiple ANTIHYPERTENSIVES, the ambulatory-blood- pressure changes appeared to relate to the degree of blood -pressure control. In this regard, study subjects whose  7 blood pressure was well controlled, the reduction was minimal and similar to that seen in healthy subjects. In study subjects whose blood pressur e was not controlled, the reduction was greater although this reduction was not associated with hypotensive symptoms in the majority of subjects. In patients receiving concomitant antihypertensive medicin al products , tadalafil 20  mg may induce a blood pres sure decrease, which (with the exception of alpha blockers -see above -) is, in general, minor and not likely to be clinically relevant. Analysis of phase 3 clinical trial data showed no difference in adverse events in patients taking tadalafil with or with out antihypertensive medicinal products . However, appropriate clinical advice should be given to patients regarding a possible decrease in blood pressure when they are treated with antihypertensive medicin al products .
> RIOCIGUAT  Preclinical studies showed an additive systemic blood pressure lowering effect when PDE5  inhibitors were combined with RIOCIGUAT. In clinical studies, RIOCIGUAT has been shown to augment the hypotensive effects of PDE5  inhibitors. There was no evidence of favourable clinical effect of the combination in the population studied. Concomitant use of RIOCIGUAT with PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil , is contraindicated (see section  4.3).  
> CYP1A2 substrates (e.g. THEOPHYLLINE)  When tadalafil 10  mg was administered with THEOPHYLLINE (a non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor) in a clinical pharma cology study, there was no pharmacokinetic interaction. The only pharmacodynamic effect was a small (3.5  bpm) increase in heart rate. Although this effect is minor and was of no clinical significance in this study, it should be considered when co -administe ring these medicin al products .
> Ethinylestradiol and TERBUTALINE  Tadalafil has been demonstrated to produce an increase in the oral bioavailability of ethinylestradiol; a similar increase may be expected with oral administration of TERBUTALINE, although th e clinical consequence of this is uncertain. 
> Acetylsalicylic acid  Tadalafil (10  mg and 20 mg) did not potentiate the increase in bleeding time caused by acetyl SALICYLIC ACID.
