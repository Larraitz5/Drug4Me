> In vitro transport studies showed that SITAGLIPTIN is a substrate for p -glycoprotein and organic anion transport er-3 (OAT3). OAT3 mediated transport of SITAGLIPTIN was inhibited in vitro by PROBENECID,  although the risk of clinically meaningful interactions is considered to be low. Concomitant  administration of OAT3 inhibitors has not been evaluated in vivo .
> Metfor min: Co-administration of multiple twice -daily doses of 1,000 mg METFORMIN with 50  mg SITAGLIPTIN did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of SITAGLIPTIN in patients with type  
2 diabetes. 
> CICLOSPORIN: A study was conducted to assess the effect of CICLOSPORIN, a potent inhibitor of  p-glycoprotein, on the pharmacokinetics of SITAGLIPTIN. Co -administration of a single 100 mg oral dose  of SITAGLIPTIN and a single 600 mg oral dose of CICLOSPORIN increased the AUC and Cmax of SITAGLIPTIN by approximately 29 % and 68  %, respectively. These changes in sitagl iptin pharmacokinetics were not considered to be clinically meaningful. The renal clearance of sitaglipti n was not meaningfully altered. Therefore, meaningful interactions would not be expected with othe r p-glycoprotein inhibitors. 
> DIGOXIN: SITAGLIPTIN had a small effect on plasma DIGOXIN concentrations. Following administration of  
0.25 mg DIGOXIN concomitantly with 100  mg of SITAGLIPTIN daily for 10  days, the plasma AUC of  DIGOXIN was increased on average by 11 %, and the plasma Cmax on average by 18 %. No dose  adjustment of DIGOXIN is recommended. However, patients at risk of DIGOXIN toxicity should be  monitored for this when SITAGLIPTIN and DIGOXIN are administered concomitantly.
