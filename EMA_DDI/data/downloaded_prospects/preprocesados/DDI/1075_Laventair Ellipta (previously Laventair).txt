> Beta2-adrenergic blockers may weaken or antagonise the effect of beta 2-adrenergic agonists, such as VILANTEROL . Concurrent use of either non- selective or selective beta- adrenergic blockers should be avoided unless there are compelling reasons for their use. 
> VILANTEROL is a substrate of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. KETOCONAZOLE , CLARITHROMYCIN,  ITRACONAZOLE, RITONAVIR, TELITHROMYCIN ) may inhibit the metabolism of, and increase the systemic exposure to, VILANTEROL. Co -administration with KETOCONAZOLE (400 mg) in healthy volunteers increased mean VILANTEROL AUC (0-t) and C max, 65% and 22% respectively. The increase in VILANTEROL exposure was not associated with an increase in beta- adrenergic agonist related systemic effects on heart rate, blood POTASSIUM or QT interval (corrected using the Fridericia method). Care is advised when co -administering UMECLIDINIUM/VILANTEROL with KETOCONAZOLE a nd other known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors as there is potential for an increased systemic exposure to VILANTEROL, which could lead to an increase in the potential for adverse reactions . VERAPAMIL, a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, did not significantly affect the  pharmacokinetics of VILANTEROL. 
> UMECLIDINIUM is a substrate of cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). The steady- state pharmacokinetics of UMECLIDINIUM was assessed in healthy volunteers lacking CYP2D6 (poor metabolisers). No effect on UMECLIDINIUM AUC or Cmax was observed at a 8- fold higher dose. An approximately 1.3- fold increase in UMECLIDINIUM AUC was observed at 16- fold higher dose with no effect on UMECLIDINIUM C max. Based on the magnitude of these changes, no clinically relevant interaction is expected when  UMECLIDINIUM/VILANTEROL is co-administered with CYP2D6 inhibitors or when administered to patients  genetically deficient in CYP2D6 activity (poor metabolisers).
> Both UMECLIDINIUM and VILANTEROL are substrates of the P -glycoprotein transporter (P -gp). The  effect of the moderate P -gp inhibitor VERAPAMIL (240 mg once daily) on the steady- state pharmacokinetics of UMECLIDINIUM and VILANTEROL was assessed in healthy volunteers. No effect of VERAPAMIL was observed on 6 UMECLIDINIUM or VILANTEROL C max. An approximately 1.4 -fold increase in UMECLIDINIUM AUC was observed with no effect on VILANTEROL AUC. Based on the magnitude of these changes, no clinically relevant drug interaction is expected when UMECLIDINIUM/VILANTEROL is co-administered with P -gp inhibi tors.
> Co-administration of  UMECLIDINIUM/VILANTEROL with other long- acting muscarinic antagonists, long -acting beta 2-adrenergic agonists or medicinal products containing either of these agents has not been studie d and is not recommended  as it may potentiate known inhaled muscarinic antagonist or beta 2-adrenergic agonist adverse reactions (see section s 4.4 and 4.9 ).
> Concomitant hypokalaemic treatment with methylxanthine derivatives, steroids, or non- POTASSIUM -sparing DIURETICS may potentiate the possible hypokalaemic effect of beta 2-adrenergic agonists, therefore use with caution (see section 4.4).
