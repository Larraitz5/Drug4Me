> A drug-interaction study in adults of ipilimumab administered alone and in combination with chemotherapy (DACARBAZINE or PACLITAXEL/CARBOPLATIN) was conducted evaluating interaction with CYP isozymes (particularly CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4) in patients with treatment- naive advanced melanoma. No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic drug- drug interaction was observed between ipilimumab and PACLITAXEL/CARBOPLATIN, DACARBAZINE or its metabolite, 
5-aminoimidazole -4-carboxamide (AIC).
