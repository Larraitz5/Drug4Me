> Concomitant hypokalaemic treatment with methylxanthine derivatives, steroids, or non -POTASSIUM -sparing DIURETICS may potentiate the possible hypokalaemic effect of beta 2-adrenergic agonists , therefore caution is required (see section  4.4).
> Inhibition of the key contributors of INDACATEROL clearance, CYP3A4 and P -glycoprotein (P -gp) raises the systemic exposure of INDACATEROL by up to two -fold. The magnitude of exposure increases due to interactions does not raise any safety concerns given the safety experience of treatment with Hirobriz  Breezhaler  in clinical studies of up to one year at doses up to twice the maximum recommended therapeutic do se.
