> No data on concomitant administration of TWINRIX ADULT with specific hepatitis A immunoglobulin or hepatitis B immunoglobulin have been generated. However, when the monovalent hepatitis A and hepatitis B VACCINES were administered concomitantly with SPECIFIC IMMUNOGLOBULINS, no influence on seroconversion was observed although it may result in lower antibody titres. 
> Although the concomitant administration of TWINRIX ADULT and OTHER VACCINES has not specifically been studied, it is anticipated that, if different syringes and other injection sites are used, no interaction will be observed.
