> The following medicinal products  may impact the accuracy of the diagnostic test. Concomitant use  is to be avoided  with (see also section  4.2 and section  4.4): 
• Medicinal products that directly affect the pituitary secretion of growth hormone (such as SOMATOSTATIN, insulin, GLUCOCORTICOIDS , and cyclooxygenase inhibitors such as acetylsalicylic acid or indometacin ). 
• Medicinal products that may transiently elevate growth hormone concentrations (such as CLONIDINE, LEVODOPA , and insulin).  
• Medicinal products that may blunt the growth hormone response to macimorelin (such as muscarinic antagonists: ATROPINE, anti -THYROID medicinal products : PROPYLTHIOURACIL and growth hormone medicinal products).  Growth hormone medicinal products should be discontinued at least 1 month  before administering macimorelin . Sufficient washout time (five elimination half-lives) of medicinal products prior to administration of macimorelin is recommended. 
> Co-administration of macimorelin with medicinal products with a potential  to induce torsades de pointes (antipsychotic  medicinal products e.g.  CHLORPROMAZINE, HALOPERIDOL, ANTIBIOTICS (e.g., MOXIFLOXACIN,  ERYTHROMYCIN, CLARITHROMYCIN ), anti-arrhythmics Class  Ia (e.g. QUINIDINE ), and Class  III (e.g. AMIODARONE, PROCAINAMIDE, SOTALOL ) or any other medicinal products that may induce torsades de pointes) should be avoided (see section  4.4).
