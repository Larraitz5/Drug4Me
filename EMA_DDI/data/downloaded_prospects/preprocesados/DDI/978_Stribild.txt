> Co-administration of STRIBILD  with medicinal products  that are primarily metaboli sed by CYP3A or CYP2D6, or are substrates of P -gp, BCRP, OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 may result in incre ased plas ma concentrations of those products , which could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions  (see Concomitant use contraindicated and section 4.3).  Co-administration of STRIBILD with medicinal products that have active meta bolite(s) formed by CYP3A may result in reduced plasma concentrations of these active metabolite(s). 
> Co-administration of STRIBILD  with medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A may decrease the clearance of COBICISTAT, resulting in increased COBICISTAT plasma concentrations. 
> ELVITEGRAVIR is a modest inducer and may have the potential to induce CYP2C9 and/or inducible UGT ENZYMES; as such it may decrease the plasma concentration of substrates of these ENZYMES .  ELVITEGRAVIR  is metaboli sed by CYP3A  and, t o a minor extent, by UGT1A 1.  Medicinal products that induce CYP3A activity are  expected to increase the clearance of ELVITEGRAVIR, resulting in decreased plasma concentration of ELVITEGRAVIR which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of STRIBILD  and development of resistance  (see Concomitant use contraindicated and section 4.3).
> Co-administration of STRIBILD  and some medicinal products that are primar ily metaboli sed by CYP3A may result in increased plasma concentrations of these products, which are associated with the potential for serious and/or life -threatening reactions  such as peripheral vasospasm or ischa emia (e.g. , DIHYDROERGOTAMINE, ERGOTAMINE, ergometrine ), or myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis (e. g., SIMVASTATIN,  LOVASTATIN), or prolonged or increased sedation or respiratory depression (e. g., orally administered MIDAZOLAM or TRIAZOLAM).  Co-administration of STRIBILD and o ther medicinal products  
10 primarily metabolised by CYP3A such as AMIODARONE, QUINIDINE, cisapri de, PIMOZIDE, LURASIDONE, alfuzo sin and SILDENAFIL  for pulmonary arterial hypertension is contraindicated (see section  4.3).
> Co-administration of STRIBILD  and some medicinal products that induce CYP3A  such as St.  John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum ), rifampi cin, CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENOBARBITAL and PHENYTOIN may result in significantly decreased  COBICISTAT and ELVITEGRAVIR plasma concentrations, which may result in loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance (see section  4.3).
> Renally eliminated medicinal products  Since EMTRICITABINE and TENOFOVIR are primarily eliminated by the kidne ys, co -administration of STRIBILD  with medicinal products that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion (e.g. CIDOFOVIR) may increase serum concentrations of EMTRICITABINE, TENOFOVIR and/or the co- administered medicinal products. 
> Use of STRIBILD  should be avoided wit h concurrent or recent use of nephrotoxic medicinal product s.  Some examples include, but are not limited to, aminoglycosides, AMPHOTERICIN B, FOSCARNET, GANCICLOVIR, PENTAMIDINE, VANCOMYCIN, CIDOFOVIR or interleukin- 2 (also called ALDESLEUKIN) .

If the combination is needed, the recommended dose of RIFABUTIN is 150 mg 3  times per week on set days (for example Monday -Wednesday -Friday).  Increased monitoring for RIFABUTIN -associated adverse reactions including neut ropenia and uveitis is warranted due to an expected increase in exposure to desacetyl -RIFABUTIN.  Further dose reduction of RIFABUTIN has not been studied.  It should be kept in mind that a twice weekly dose of 150 mg may not provide an optimal exposure to RIFABUTIN thus leading to a risk of rifamycin resistance and a treatment failure.

40-60% increase in systemic exposure to DIDANOSINE.  Co-administration of STRIBILD and DIDANOSINE is not recommended.
> Increased systemic exposure to DIDANOSINE may increase DIDANOSINE related adverse reactions.  Rarely, pancreatitis  and lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, have been reported.  Co- administration of TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL and DIDANOSINE at a dose of 400 mg daily has been associated with a significant decrease in CD4 cell count, possibly due to an intracellular interaction increasing phosphorylated (i.e. active) DIDANOSINE.  A decreased dosage of 
250 mg DIDANOSINE co- administered with TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL therapy has been associated with reports of high rates of virological failure within several tested combinations for the t reatment of HIV-1 infection.

Concomitant use of STRIBILD and CORTICOSTEROIDS that are metabolised by CYP3A (e.g. flutic asone propionate or other inhaled or nasal CORTICOSTEROIDS) may increase the risk of development of systemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression.
> Co-administration with CYP3A -metabolised CORTICOSTEROIDS is not reco mmended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk, in which case patients should be monitored for systemic corticosteroid effects. Alternative CORTICOSTEROIDS which are less dependent on CYP3A metabolism e.g. BECLOMETHASONE for intrana sal or inhalational use should be considered, particularly for long -term use.
