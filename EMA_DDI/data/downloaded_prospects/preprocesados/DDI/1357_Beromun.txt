> BEROMUN has been co- administered with interferon- gamma in the ILP setting but no added value has been demonstrated. The addition of interferon- gamma to the tasonermin perfusate seems not to be associated with significant increases in endogenous production of tasonermi n or other inflammatory cytokines as shown in patients with severe trauma. Clinical data however indicate that the overall incidence of adverse events is increased if patients are simultaneously exposed to tasonermin and interferon -gamma.
