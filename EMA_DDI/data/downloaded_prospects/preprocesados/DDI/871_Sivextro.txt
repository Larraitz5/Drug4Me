> Resistant Protein [BCRP ] substrate) alone or in combination with tedizolid  phosphate  (once -daily
200 mg oral dose), ROSUVASTATIN AUC and Cmax increased by approximately 70% and 55%,respectively, when coadministered with tedizolid  phosphate . Theref ore, orally administered tedizolidphosphate  can result in inhibition of  BCRP at the intestinal level. If  possible, an interruption of  the co
-administered BCRP substrate medicinal product (such as IMATINIB, LAPATINIB, METHOTREXATE,PITAVASTATIN, ROSUVASTATIN, sulf asalazine, and TOPOTECAN) should be considered during the 
6 days oftreatment with oral tedizolid  phosphate .In a clinical study comparing the single dose (
2 mg) pharmacokinetics of  MIDAZOLAM (CYP3A4substrate) alone or in combination with TEDIZOLID PHOSPHATE  (once -daily 200 mg oral dose f or 
10 days),MIDAZOLAM AUC and Cmax when co -administered with TEDIZOLID PHOSPHATE
 were 81% and 83% ofmidazolam AUC and Cmax when administered alone, respectively. This ef f ect is not clinicallymeaningf ul, and no dose adjustment f or co
-administered CYP3A4 substrates is necessary duringtedizolid phosphate
 treatment.Pharmacodynamic interactions
> Tedizolid  is a reversible inhibitor of  monoamine oxidase (MAO) in vitro
; however, no interaction isanticipated when comparing the IC

 mg oral TEDIZOLID PHOSPHATE  at steady stateon PSEUDOEPHEDRINE and tyramine pressor ef f ects were conducted in healthy volunteers. Nomeaningf ul changes in blood pressure
 or heart rate with PSEUDOEPHEDRINE were observed in the healthyvolunteers, and no clinically relevant increase in tyramine sensitivity was observed. Potential serotonergic interactions
