> Concomitant use not recommended  QT prolonging medicinal products  
- Cardiovascular QT prolonging medicinal products (e.g. QUINIDINE, DISOPYRAMIDE, BEPRIDIL, SOTALOL, IBUTILIDE, AMIODARONE). 
- Non cardiovascular QT prolonging medicinal products (e.g. PIMOZIDE, ZIPRASIDONE, SERTINDOLE, MEFLOQUINE, HALOFANTRINE, PENTAMIDINE, CISAPRIDE, intravenous ERYTHROMYCIN). The concomitant use of cardiovascular and non cardiovascular QT prolonging medicinal pr oducts with ivabradine should be avoided since QT prolongation may be exacerbated by heart rate reduction. If the combination appears necessary, close cardiac monitoring is needed (see section 4.4).  7 Classified as confidential by the European Medicines Agency   Concomitant use with precaution
> POTASSIUM -depleting DIURETICS (thiazide DIURETICS and LOOP DIURETICS)  Hypokalemia can increase the risk of arrhythmia. As ivabradine may cause bradycardia, the resulting combination of hypokalemia and bradycardia is a predisposing factor to the onset of severe arrhythmias, especially in patients with long QT syndrome, whether congenital or substance -induced.
> Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors  The concomitant use of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as azole antifungals (KETOCONAZOLE, ITRACONAZOLE), macrolide ANTIBIOTICS (CLARITHROMYCIN, ERYTHROMYCIN per os , JOSAMYCIN, TELITHROMYCIN), HIV pro tease inhibitors (NELFINAVIR, RITONAVIR) and NEFAZODONE is contraindicated (see section 4.3). The potent CYP3A4 inhibitors KETOCONAZOLE (200 mg once daily) and JOSAMYCIN (1 g twice daily) increased ivabradine mean plasma exposure by 7 to 8 fold.  Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors   Specific interaction studies in healthy volunteers and patients have shown that the combination of ivabradine with the heart rate reducing agents DILTIAZEM or VERAPAMIL resulted in an increase in ivabradine exposure (2 to 3 fold increase  in AUC) and an additional heart rate reduction of 5 bpm. The concomitant use of ivabradine with these medicinal products is contraindicated  (see section 4. 3).
> Concomitant use not recommended Ivabradine exposure was increased by 2 -fold following the co- administration with GRAPEFRUIT JUICE. Therefore the intake of GRAPEFRUIT JUICE should be avoided.
> Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors  The concomitant use of ivabradine with other moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. FLUCONAZOLE) may be  considered at the starting dose of 2.5 mg twice daily and if resting heart rate is above 70 bpm, with monitoring of heart rate .
> CYP3A4 inducers  CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, barbiturates, PHENYTOIN, Hypericum perforatum  [St John’s Wort]) may decrease ivabradine exposure and activity. The concomitant use of CYP3A4 inducing medicinal products may require an adjustment of the dose of ivabradine. The combination of ivabradine 10 mg twice daily with St John’s Wort was shown to reduce ivabradine AUC by half . The intake of St John’s Wort should be restricted during the treatment with ivabradine.
> Other concomitant use  Specific interaction studies have shown no clinically significant effect of the following medicinal products on pharmacokinetics and pharmacody namics of ivabradine: PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS (OMEPRAZOLE, LANSOPRAZOLE), SILDENAFIL, HMG Co
