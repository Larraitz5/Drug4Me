> Since olanzapine is metabolised by CYP1A2, substances that can specifically induce or inhibit this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine.Induction of CYP1A2The metabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking and CARBAMAZEPINE, which may lead to reduced olanzapine concentrati ons. Only slight to moderate increase in olanzapine clearance has been observed. The clinical consequences are likely to be limited, but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase of olanzapine dose may be considered if necessary (see section 4.2).Inhibition of CYP1A2Fluvoxamine, a specific CYP 1A2 inhibitor, has been shown to significantly inhibit the metabolism of olanzapine. The mean increase in olanzapine Cmax following FLUVOXAMINE was 54% in female non-smokers and 77% in male smokers. The me an increase in olanzapine AUC was 52% and 108% respectively. A lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using FLUVOXAMINE or any other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as CIPROFLOXACIN. A decrease in the dose of olanzapine should b e considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP 1A2 is initiated.Decreased bioavailability
> Olanzapine may antagonise the effects of direct and indirect DOPAMINE AGONISTS.Olanzapine does not inhibit the main CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro (e.g. 1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, 
3A4). Thus no particular interaction is expected as verified through in vivo studies where no inhibition of metabo lism of the following active substances was found: tricyclic antidepressant (representing mostly CYP2D6 pathway), WARFARIN (CYP2C9), THEOPHYLLINE (CYP1A2) or DIAZEPAM (CYP3A4 and 2C19).8Olanzapine showed no interaction when co -administered with LITHIUM or BIPERIDEN.Therapeutic monitoring of valproate plasm a levels did not indicate that valproate dosage adjustment is required after the introduction of concomitant olanzapine.General CNS activity
> Caution should be exercised in patients who consume alcohol or receive medicinal products that can cause CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM depression.The concomitant use of olanzapine with anti -Parkinsonian medicinal products in patients with Parkinson's disease and dementia is not recommended (see section 4.4).QTc interval
