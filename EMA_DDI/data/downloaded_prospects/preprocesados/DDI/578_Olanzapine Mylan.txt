> Induction of CYP1A2  The metabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking and CARBAMAZEPINE, which may lead to reduced olanzapine concentrations. Only slight to moderate increase in olanzapine clearance has been observed. The clinical consequences are likely to be limited, but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase of olanzapine dose may be considered if necessary (see section 4.2). 
> Inhibition of CYP1A2  FLUVOXAMINE, a specific CYP1A2 inhibitor, has been shown to significantly inhibit the metabolism of olanzapine. The mean increase in olanzapine Cmax following FLUVOXAMINE was 54 % in female non -smokers and 77 % in male smokers. The mean increase in olanzap ine AUC was 52  % and 108 % respectively. A lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using FLUVOXAMINE or any other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as CIPROFLOXACIN. A decrease in the dose of olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated.  Decreased bioavailability   Activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral olanzapine by 50  % to 60 % and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after olanzapine.
