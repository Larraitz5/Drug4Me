> No formal clinical drug interaction studies ha ve been performed. At doses higher than the clinically relevant dose, induction and time -dependent inhibition of CYP2B6 was observed in vitro. The net effect on CYP2B6 substrates (e.g., BUPROPION and EFAVIRENZ) in vivo is unknown.  ONPATTRO is not expected to cause interactions or  be affected by inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 ENZYMES.
