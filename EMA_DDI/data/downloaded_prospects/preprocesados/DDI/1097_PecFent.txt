> Concomitant use of medicinal products containing SODIUM OXYBATE and fentanyl is contraindicated (see section 4.3). The treatment of SODIUM OXYBATE should be discontinued before start of treatment with Pec
> Fent with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. RITONAVIR, KETOCONAZOLE, ITRACONAZOLE, TROLEANDOMYCIN, CLARITHROMYCIN, and NELFINAVIR) or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e .g. AMPRENAVIR, APREPITANT, DILTIAZEM, ERYTHROMYCIN, FLUCONAZOLE, FOSAMPRENAVIR, GRAPEFRUIT JUICE, and VERAPAMIL) may result in increased fentanyl plasma concentrations, potentially causing serious adverse drug reactions including fatal respiratory depress ion. Patients receiving Pec
> The concomitant use of other CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM depr essants, including OTHER OPIOIDS, sedatives or hypnotics, general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquillisers, skeletal MUSCLE RELAXANTS, gabapentinoids (GABAPENTIN and PREGABALIN)  sedating antihistamines and alcohol may produce additive depressant effect s. Concomitant use of OPIOIDS with sedative medicines such as benzodiazepines or related drugs increases the risk of sedation, respiratory depression, coma and death because of additive CNS depressant effect. The lowest effective dose of sedative medicines  should be used  and duration of concomitant use should be limited (see section 4.4). 
> Serotoninergic  medicinal products:  Coadministration of fentanyl with a serotoninergic medicinal product , such as a Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitor (SSRI) or a Ser otonin NOREPINEPHRINE Re -uptake Inhibitor (SNRI) or a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI), may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. 
> The concomitant use of partial opioid agonists/antagonists (e.g. BUPRENORPHINE, NALBUPHINE, PENTAZOCINE) is not recommended. They have high affinity to opioid receptors with relatively low intrinsic activity and , therefore,  partially antagonise the analgesic effect of fentanyl and may induce withdrawal symptoms in opioid depend ent pat ients. 
> Concomitant use of nasally administered OXYMETAZOLINE has been shown to decrease the absorption of Pec
