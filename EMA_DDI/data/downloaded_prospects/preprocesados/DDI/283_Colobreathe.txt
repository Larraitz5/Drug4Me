> Caution should be taken with concomitant use with other formulations of COLISTIMETHATE SODIUM as there is little experience and there is a possibility of summative toxicity. 
> Concomitant use of inhaled COLISTIMETHATE SODIUM with other medicinal products  that are potentially nephrotoxic or neurotoxic, such as aminoglycosides, or neuromuscular blocking products, such as curariform agents should be undertaken with caution.  Co-treatment with COLISTIMETHATE SODIUM and MACROLIDES such as AZITHROMYCIN and CLARITHROMYCIN, or FLUOROQUINOLONES such as NORFLOXACIN and CIPROFLOXACIN should be undertaken with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis (see section 4.4).
