> 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Hum ira has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic arthritis patients taking HUMIRA as monotherapy and those taking concomitant METHOTREXATE. Antibody formation was lower when HUMIRA was given togethe r with METHOTREXATE in comparison with use as monotherapy. Administration of HUMIRA without METHOTREXATE resulted in increased formation of antibodies, increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab (see section 5.1). The combination of HUMIRA an d ANAKINRA is not recommended (see section 4.4 “Concurrent administration of biologic DMARDS or TNF -antagonists”). The combination of HUMIRA and ABATACEPT is not recommended (see section 4.4 “Concurrent administration of biologic DMARDS or TNF -antagonist s”).
