> Dolutegravir is eliminated mainly through metabolism by UGT1A1. Dolutegravir is also a substrate of UGT1A3, UGT1A9, CYP3A4, Pgp, and BCRP; therefore medicinal products  that induce those ENZYMES may decrease dolutegr avir plasma concentration and reduce the therapeutic effect of dolutegravir  (see Table 3). Co-administration of dolutegravir and other medicinal products that inhibit these ENZYMES may increase dolutegravir plasma concentration (see Table 3). 
> In vitro , dolutegravir inhibited the renal organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2)  and multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter (MATE) 1. In vivo , a 10-14% decrease of creatinine clearance ( secretory fraction  is dependent on OCT2 and MATE -1 transport ) was observed in patients . In vivo , dolutegravir may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products  in which excretion is dependent upon OCT2 and/or MATE -1 (e.g. FAMPRIDINE [also known as dalfampridine], metform in) (see Table 3). 
> In vitro , dolutegravir inhibited the renal  uptake transporter s, organic anion transporters  (OAT1) and OAT3.  Based on the lack of effect on the in vivo  pharmacokinetics of the OAT substrate TENOFOVIR , in vivo  inhibition 7 of OAT1 is unlikely. Inhibition of OAT3 has not been studied in vivo . Dolutegravir may increase plasma concentrations of medic inal products in which excretion is dependent upon OAT3.

In paediatric patients the weight -based  once daily dose should be administered  twice daily.  Dolutegravir  should not be used with ETRAVIRINE without co-administration of a tazanavir/ RITONAVIR, DARUNAVIR/RITONAVIR or LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR  in INI-resistant patients  (see further below in table) .

In paediatric patients the weight -based  once daily dose should be administered  twice daily.  Alternative combinations that do not include these metabolic inducers should be used where possible  in INI -resistant patients.
