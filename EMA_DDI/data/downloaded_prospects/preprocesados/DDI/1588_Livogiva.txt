> In a study of 15 healthy subjects administered DIGOXIN daily to steady state, a single teriparatide  dose did not alter the cardiac effect of DIGOXIN. However, sporadic case reports have suggested that hypercalcaemia may predispose patients to digitalis toxicity. Because teriparatide  transiently increases serum CALCIUM, LIVOGIVA should be used with caution in patients taking digitalis.   Teriparatide has been evaluated in pharmacodynamic interaction studies with HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE. No clinically significant interactions were noted. 
> Co-administration of RALOXIFENE or hormone replacement therapy with teriparatide  did not alter the effects of teriparatide  on serum or urine CALCIUM or on clinical adverse events.
