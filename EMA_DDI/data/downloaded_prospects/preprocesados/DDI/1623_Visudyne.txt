> It is possible that concomitant use of other photosensitising medicinal products  (e.g. TETRACYCLINES, sulphonamides, phenothiazines, sulfonylurea, hypoglyc aemic medicinal products , thiazide DIURETICS, and GRISEOFULVIN) could increase the potential for photosensitivity reactions . Caution should therefore be exercised when using VISUDYNE concomitantly with other photosensitising medicinal products  (see 
“Photosensitivity and exposure to light ” under  section  4.4).
> Although there is no clinical evidence, theoretical data  suggest that  antioxidants (e.g. beta -carotene) or medicinal products  which  scavenge free radicals (e.g. dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), f ormate, MANNITOL or alcohol) might  quench the activated OXYGEN species generated by verteporfin, resulting in decreased verteporfin activity.
