> 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  The interactions of OKEDI  with co -administration of other medicinal products have not been systematically evaluated. The interaction data provided in this section are based on studies with oral risperidone.  9 Pharmacodynamic- related interactions 
> Centrally-acting medicinal  products and alcohol OKEDI  should be used with caution in combination with other centrally- acting substances , notably including alcohol, opiates, antihistamines and benzodiazepines due to the increased risk of sedation.
> LEVODOPA and DOPAMINE AGONISTS OKEDI may antagonise the effect of LEVODOPA and other DOPAMINE AGONISTS. If this combination is deemed necessary,  particularly in end- stage Parkinson's disease, the lowest effective dose of each treatment should be prescribed. 
> PALIPERIDONE Concomitant use of OKEDI  with PALIPERIDONE is not recommended as PALIPERIDONE is the active metabolite of risperidone and the combination of the two may lead to additive active moiety  exposure.  Pharmacokinetic- related interactions 
> Strong C YP2D6 inhibitors  Co-administration of OKEDI  with a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor may increase the plasma concentrations of risperidone, but less so of the active moiety . Higher doses of a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor may elevate concentrations of the risperidone active moiety  (e.g., PAROXETINE, see below). It is expected that other CYP2D6 inhibitors, such as QUINIDINE, may affect the plasma concentrations of risperidone in a similar way. When concomitant PAROXETINE, QUINIDINE, or another strong CYP2D6 inhibitor, especially at higher doses, is initiated or discontinued, the physician should re -evaluate the dosing of OKEDI.
> CYP3A4 and/or P-gp inhibitors Co-administration of OKEDI  with a strong CYP3A4 and/or P- gp inhibitor may substantially elevate plasma concentrations of the risperidone active moiety . When concomitant ITRACONAZOLE 10 or another strong CYP3A4 and/or P- gp inhibitor is initiated or discontinued, the physician should re-evaluate the dosing of OKEDI.
> CYP3A4 and/or P-gp inducers Co-administration of OKEDI  with a strong CYP3A4 and/or P-gp inducer may decrease the plasma concentrations of the risperidone active moiety . When concomitant CARBAMAZEPINE or another strong CYP3A4 and/or P- gp inducer is initiated or discontinued, the physician should re-evaluate th e dosing of OKEDI . CYP3A4 inducers exert their effect in a time-dependent manner and may take at least 2 weeks to reach maximal effect after introduction. Conversely, on discontinuation, CYP3A4 induction may take at least 2 weeks to decline.  Highly protein-bound medicinal products When risperidone is taken together with highly protein-bound medicinal products, there is no clinically relevant displacement of either medicine from the plasma proteins.
> Effect of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of risperidone  Antibacterials:  
• ERYTHROMYCIN, a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor and P -gp inhibitor, does not change the pharmacokinetics of risperidone and the active moiety . 
• Rifampicin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer and a P- gp inducer, decreased the plasma concentrations of the active moiety . ANTICHOLINESTERASES:  
• DONEPEZIL and GALANTAMINE, both CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 substrates, do not show a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of risperidone and the active moiety . ANTIEPILEPTICS:  
• CARBAMAZEPINE, a strong CYP3A4 inducer and a P-gp inducer, has been shown to decrease the plasma concentrations of the active moiety . Similar effects may be observed with e.g., PHENYTOIN and PHENOBARBITAL which also induce CYP3A4 hepatic enzyme, as well as P -glycoprotein. 
• TOPIRAMATE modestly reduced the bioavailability of risperi done, but not that of the active moiety . Therefore, this interaction is unlikely to be of clinical significance.  Antifungals: 
• ITRACONAZOLE, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and a P-gp inhibitor, at a dosage of 200 mg/day increased the plasma concentrations of the  active moiety  by about 70%, at risperidone doses of 2 to 8 mg/day.  
• KETOCONAZOLE, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and a P-gp inhibitor, at a dosage of 200 mg/day increased the plasma concentrations of risperidone and decreased the plasma concentrations of 9-hydr oxy-risperidone. ANTIPSYCHOTICS: 
• Phenothiazines may increase the plasma concentrations of risperidone but not those of the active moiety . ANTIVIRALS:  
• PROTEASE INHIBITORS: No formal study data are available; however, since RITONAVIR is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and a weak CYP2D6 inhibitor, RITONAVIR and RITONAVIR-boosted PROTEASE INHIBITORS potentially raise concentrations of the risperidone active moiety .
>  11 Beta-blockers: 
• Some beta- blockers may increase the plasma concentrations of risperidone but not those of the active moiety .  CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS:  
• VERAPAMIL, a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 and an inhibitor of P- gp, increases the plasma concentration of risperidone and the active moiety . Gastrointestinal drugs:  
• H2-RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS: CIMETIDINE and RANITIDINE, both weak inhibitors of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, increased the bioavailability of risperidone, but only marginally that of the active moiety . SSRIs and tricyclic ANTIDEPRESSANTS:  
• FLUOXETINE, a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor, increases the plasma concentration of risperidone, but less so of the active moiety . 
• PAROXETINE, a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor, increases the plasma concentrations of risperidone, but, at dosages up to 20 mg/day, less so of the active moiety . However, higher doses of PAROXETINE may elevate concentrations of the risperidone active moiety . 
• Tricyclic ANTIDEPRESSANTS may increase the plasma concentrations of risperidone but not those of the active moiety . AMITRIPTYLINE does no t affect the pharmacokinetics of risperidone or the active antipsychotic fraction.  
• SERTRALINE, a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6, and FLUVOXAMINE, a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, at dosages up to 100 mg/day are not associated with clinically significant changes in concentrations of the risperidone active moiety . However, doses higher than 100 mg/day of SERTRALINE or FLUVOXAMINE may elevate concentrations of the risperidone active moiety .
