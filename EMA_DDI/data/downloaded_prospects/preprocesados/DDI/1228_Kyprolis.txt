> In vitro  studies indicated that carfilzomib did not induce human CYP3A4 in cultured human hepatocytes. A clinical study using oral MIDAZOLAM as a CYP3A probe conducted with carfilzomib at a dose of 27  mg/m2 (2-10 minute infusion) demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of MIDAZOLAM were unaffected by concomitant carfilzomib administration, indicating that carfilzomib is not expected to inhibit the metabolism of CYP3A4/5 substrates and is not a CYP3A4 inducer in human subjects. No clinical study was conducted with a dose of 56  mg/m2. However, it is unknown whether carfilzomib is an inducer of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19 and 2B6 at therapeutic concentrations. Caution should be observed when carfilzomib is combined with medicinal products that are substrates of these ENZYMES, such as oral contraceptives. Effective measures to avoid pregnancy should be taken (see section  4.6, and refer also to the current LENALIDOMIDE summary of product characteristics), an alternative method of effective contraception should be used if the patient is using oral contraceptives. 
>  Carfilzomib is a P -glycoprotein (P -gp) but not a BCRP substrate. However, given that KYPROLIS is administrated intravenously and is extensively metabolised, the pharmacokinetic profile of carfilzomib is unlikely to be affected by P -gp or BCRP inhibitors or inducers. In vitro , at concentrations (3  ÂµM) lower than those expected at therapeutic doses, carfilzomib inhibits the efflux transport of DIGOXIN, a P-gp substrate, by 25%. Caution should be observed when carfilzomib is combined with substrates of P-gp (e.g. DIGOXIN, COLCHICINE).
