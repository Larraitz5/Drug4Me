> 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Efavirenz is an in vivo  inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and UGT1A1. Compounds that are substrates of these ENZYMES may have decreased plasma concentrations when co-administered with efavirenz. In vitro efavirenz is also an inhibitor of CYP3A4. Theoretically, efavirenz may therefore initially increase the exposure to CYP3A4 substrates and caution is warranted for CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic index (see section 4.3). Efavirenz may be an inducer of CYP2C19 and CYP2C9; however, inhibition has also been observed in vitro  and the net effect of co-administration with substrates of these ENZYMES is not clear (see section 5.2). Efavirenz exposure may be increased when given with medicinal products (for example, RITONAVIR) or food (for example, GRAPEFRUIT JUICE), which inhibit CYP3A4 or CYP2B6 activity. Compounds or herbal preparations (for example GINKGO BILOBA extracts and St. John’s wort) which induce these ENZYMES may give rise to decreased plasma concentrations of efavirenz. Concomitant use of St. John’s wort is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Concomitant use of GINKGO BILOBA extracts is not recommended (see section 4.4). QT Prolonging Drugs Efavirenz is contraindicated with concomitant use of drugs (they may cause prolonged QTc interval and Torsade de Pointes) such as: antiarrhythmics of classes IA and III, neuroleptics and antidepressant agents, certain ANTIBIOTICS including some agents of the following classes: MACROLIDES,  FLUOROQUINOLONES, imidazole, and triazole antifungal agents, certain non-sedating antihistaminics (TERFENADINE, ASTEMIZOLE), CISAPRIDE, FLECAINIDE, certain ANTIMALARIALS and METHADONE (see section 4.3). Paediatric population
> Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. Contraindications of concomitant use Efavirenz must not be administered concurrently with TERFENADINE, ASTEMIZOLE, CISAPRIDE, MIDAZOLAM, TRIAZOLAM, PIMOZIDE, BEPRIDIL, or ERGOT ALKALOIDS (for example, ERGOTAMINE, DIHYDROERGOTAMINE, ERGONOVINE, and METHYLERGONOVINE), since inhibition of their metabolism may lead to serious, life-threatening events (see section 4.3). ELBASVIR/GRAZOPREVIR Medicinal product no longer authorised9Concomitant administration of efavirenz with ELBASVIR/GRAZOPREVIR is contraindicated because it may lead to loss of virologic response to ELBASVIR/GRAZOPREVIR. This loss is due to significant decreases in ELBASVIR and GRAZOPREVIR plasma concentrations caused by CYP3A4 induction. (see section 4.3). St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) Co-administration of efavirenz and St. John’s wort or herbal preparations containing St. John’s wort is contraindicated. Plasma levels of efavirenz can be reduced by concomitant use of St. John’s wort due to induction of drug metabolising ENZYMES and/or transport proteins by St. John’s wort. If a patient is already taking St. John’s wort, stop St. John’s wort, check viral levels and if possible efavirenz levels. Efavirenz levels may increase on stopping St. John’s wort and the dose of efavirenz may need adjusting. The inducing effect of St. John’s wort may persist for at least 2 weeks after cessation of treatment. (see section 4.3). Other interactions Interactions between efavirenz and PROTEASE INHIBITORS, antiretroviral agents other than PROTEASE INHIBITORS and other non-antiretroviral medicinal products are listed in Table 2 below (increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”, and once every 8 or 12 hours as “q8h” or

> (CYP3A4 induction) Co-administration of efavirenz with ATORVASTATIN, PRAVASTATIN, or SIMVASTATIN did not affect efavirenz AUC or Cmax values. Cholesterol levels should be periodically monitored. Dose adjustment of SIMVASTATIN may be required (refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for SIMVASTATIN). No dose adjustment is necessary for efavirenz. ROSUVASTATIN/Efavirenz Interaction not studied. ROSUVASTATIN is largely excreted unchanged via the faeces, therefore interaction with efavirenz is not expected.No dose adjustment is necessary for either medicinal product. HORMONAL CONTRACEPTIVESOral: Ethinyloestradiol + NORGESTIMATE/ Efavirenz (0.035 mg + 0.25 mg once daily/600 mg once daily) Ethinyloestradiol: AUC: ↔ Cmax: ↔ Cmin: ↓ 8% (↑ 14 to ↓ 25) NORELGESTROMIN (active metabolite): AUC: ↓ 64% (↓ 62 to ↓ 67) Cmax: ↓ 46% (↓ 39 to ↓ 52) Cmin: ↓ 82% (↓ 79 to ↓ 85) LEVONORGESTREL (active metabolite): AUC: ↓ 83% (↓ 79 to ↓ 87) Cmax: ↓ 80% (↓ 77 to ↓ 83) Cmin: ↓ 86% (↓ 80 to ↓ 90) (induction of metabolism) Efavirenz: no clinically significant interaction. The clinical significance of these effects is not known.A reliable method of barrier contraception must be used in addition to hormonal contraceptives (see section 4.6). Injection: Depomedroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA)/Efavirenz (150 mg IM single dose DMPA) In a 3-month drug interaction study, no significant differences in MPA pharmacokinetic parameters were found between subjects receiving efavirenz-containing antiretroviral therapy and subjects receiving no antiretroviral therapy. Similar results were found by other investigators, although the MPA plasma levels were more variable in the second study. In both studies, plasma PROGESTERONE levels for subjects receiving efavirenz and DMPA remained low consistent with suppression of ovulation.Because of the limited information available, a reliable method of barrier contraception must be used in addition to hormonal contraceptives (see section 4.6). Implant: ETONOGESTREL/Efavirenz Decreased exposure of ETONOGESTREL may be expected (CYP3A4 induction). There have been occasional postmarketing reports of contraceptive failure with ETONOGESTREL in efavirenz-exposed patients.A reliable method of barrier contraception must be used in addition to hormonal contraceptives (see section 4.6).Medicinal product no longer authorised21Medicinal product by therapeutic areas (dose) Effects on drug levels Mean percent change in AUC, Cmax, Cmin with confidence intervals if availablea (mechanism) Recommendation concerning co-administration with efavirenz IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTSImmunosuppressants metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, CYCLOSPORINE, TACROLIMUS, SIROLIMUS)/Efavirenz Interaction not studied. Decreased exposure of the immunosuppressant may be expected (CYP3A4 induction). These IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS are not anticipated to affect exposure of efavirenz. Dose adjustments of the immunosuppressant may be required. Close monitoring of immunosuppressant concentrations for at least 2 weeks (until stable concentrations are reached) is recommended when starting or stopping treatment with efavirenz.NON-OPIOID ANALGESICSMetamizole/Efavirenz  Co-administration of efavirenz with METAMIZOLE, which is an inducer of metabolising ENZYMES including CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 may cause a reduction in plasma concentrations of efavirenz with potential decrease in clinical efficacy.Therefore, caution is advised when METAMIZOLE and efavirenz. are administered concurrently; clinical response and/or drug levels should be monitored as appropriate. OPIOIDSMethadone/Efavirenz (stable maintenance, 35-100 mg once daily/600 mg once daily) METHADONE: AUC: ↓ 52% (↓ 33 to ↓ 66) Cmax: ↓ 45% (↓ 25 to ↓ 59) (CYP3A4 induction) In a study of HIV infected intravenous drug users, co-administration of efavirenz with METHADONE resulted in decreased plasma levels of METHADONE and signs of opiate withdrawal. The METHADONE dose was increased by a mean of 22% to alleviate withdrawal symp toms. Concomitant administration with efavirenz should be avoided due to the risk for QTc prolongation (see section 4.3). BUPRENORPHINE/NALOXONE/Efavirenz BUPRENORPHINE: AUC: ↓ 50% Norbuprenorphine: AUC: ↓ 71% Efavirenz: No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction Despite the decrease in BUPRENORPHINE exposure, no patients exhibited withdrawal symptoms. Dose adjustment of BUPRENORPHINE or efavirenz may not be necessary when co-administered. a 90% confidence intervals unless otherwise noted. b 95% confidence intervals. Other interactions: efavirenz does not bind to cannabinoid receptors. False-positive urine cannabinoid test results have been reported with some screening assays in uninfected and HIV-infected subjects receiving efavirenz. Confirmatory testing by a more specific method such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry is recommended in such cases.
