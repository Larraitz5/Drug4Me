> There is currently no reported experience in patients on the concomitant treatment with Low Molecular Weight Heparins (LMWHs), WARFARIN or the concomitant treatment with DIRECT THROMBIN INHIBITORS (e.g., DABIGATRAN) or direct Factor Xa inhibitors (e.g., ri varoxaban and APIXABAN). Therefore, the use of defibrotide with antithrombotic/fibrinolytic medicinal products is not recommended.  However, if used, in exceptional cases, caution should be exercised by closely monitoring the coagulation parameters (see section 4.4).
