> No clinically relevant interaction of co -administered chemotherapy on bevacizumab pharmacokinetics was observed based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analys es. There were neither statistical ly significan t nor clinically relevant difference s in bevacizumab clearance in patients receiving bevacizumab monotherapy compared to patients receiving bevacizumab in combination with interferon alfa -2a, ERLOTINIB  or chemotherapies (IFL, 5 -FU/LV, carboplati n/PACLITAXEL, CAPECITABINE, DOXORUBICIN or CISPLATIN/GEMCITABINE). 
> Combination of b evacizumab and SUNITINIB malate 
> In two clinical trials of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA) was reported in 7 of 19 patients treated with bevacizumab (10  mg/kg every two weeks) and SUNITINIB malate  (50 mg daily) combination. 
> Combination with PLATINUM - or taxane -based therapies (see sections  4.4 and 4.8 )
> Increased rates of severe neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, or infection with or without severe neutropenia (including some fatalities) have been observed mainly in patients treated with PLATINUM - or taxane -based therapies in the treatment of NSCLC and m
> The safety and efficacy of concomitant administration of RADIOTHERAPY and bevacizumab has not been established. 
> 11 EGFR MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES in combination with be vacizumab chemotherapy regimens 
> CRC suggest that the use  of anti -EGFR MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES PANITUMUMAB and CETUXIMAB, respectively, in combination with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy, is associated with decreased progression -free survival ( PFS) and/or overall survival ( OS), and with increased toxicity compared with bevac izumab plus chemotherapy alone.
