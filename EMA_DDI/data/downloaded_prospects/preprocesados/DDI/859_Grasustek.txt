> Due to the potential sensitivity of rapidly div iding myeloid cells to cytotoxic chemotherapyâ€š pegfilgrastim should be administered at least 24  hours after administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy. In clinical trials, pegfilgras tim has been safely administered 14 days before chemotherapy. Concomitant us e of pegfilgrastim with any chemotherapy  has not been evaluated in patients. In animal models , concomitant administration of pegfilgrastim and 5- FLUOROURACIL (5- FU) or other ANTIMETABOLITES has been shown to potentiate myelosuppression.   6
> The potential for interaction with LITHIUM, which also promotes the release of neutrophils, has not been specifically investigated. Th ere is no evidence that such an interaction would be harmful.
