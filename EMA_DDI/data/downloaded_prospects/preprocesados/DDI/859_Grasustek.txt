> Due to the potential sensitivity of rapidly divi ding myeloid cells to cytotoxic chemotherapyâ€š pegfilgrastim should be administered at least 24 hours after administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy. In clinical trials, pegfilgrastim has been safe ly administered 14 days before chemotherapy. Concomitant use of pegfilgrastim with any chemotherapy  has not been evaluated in patients. In animal models, concomitant administration of pegfilgrastim and 5-FLUOROURACIL (5-FU) or other ANTIMETABOLITES has been shown to potentiate myel osuppression. 
> The potential for interaction with LITHIUM, which also promotes  the release of neutrophils, has not been specifically investigated. There is no evidence that such an interaction woul d be harmful.
