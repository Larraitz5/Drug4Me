> There is a potential for an additive effect on the known systemic effects of carbonic anhydrase  inhibition in patients receiving an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and BRINZOLAMIDE eye drops.  The concomitant administration of eye drops containing BRINZOLAMIDE and oral carbonic anhydrase  inhibitors is not recommended. 
> There is a potential for additive effects resulting in hypotension and/or ma rked bradycardia when an ophthalmic beta -blocker solution is administered concomitantly with oral CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS, beta-adrenergic blocking agents, antiarrhythmics  (including AMIODARONE), DIGITALIS GLYCOSIDES, PARASYMPATHOMIMETICS , GUANETHIDINE . Beta blockers can decrease the response to adrenaline used to treat anaphylactic reactions.  Special caution should be exercised in patients with a history of atopy or anaphylaxis (see  section  4.4).
> The hypertensive reaction to sudden withdrawal of clonidi ne can be potentiated when taking beta-blockers.  Caution is recommended in the concomitant use of this medicinal product with CLONIDINE. 
> Potentiated systemic beta -blockade (e.g. decreased heart rate , depression ) has been reported during combined treatment with CY P2D6  inhibitors (e.g. QUINIDINE, FLUOXETINE, parox etine) and TIMOLOL.  Caution is recommended. 
> Mydriasis resulting from concomitant use of ophthalmic beta -blockers and adrenaline (EPINEPHRINE) has been reported occasionally.
