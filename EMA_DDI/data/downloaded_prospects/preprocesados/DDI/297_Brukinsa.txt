> Concomitant use of BRUKINSA and medicinal products that strongly or moderately inhibit CYP3A can increase zanubrutinib exposure. 
> The coadministration of multiple doses of ITRACONAZOLE (strong CYP3A inhibitor) in healthy volunteers increased the Cmax of zanubrutinib by 2.6-fold and AUC by 3.8-fold. The coadministration of multiple doses of strong CYP3A inhibitors VORICONAZOLE and CLARITHROMYCIN in patients with B- cell malignancies resulted in increased zanubrutinib exposures by 3.30- fold and 1.92- fold for dose -normalized AUC 0-24h and 3.29- fold and 2.01- fold for dose -normalized C max, respectively. 
> The coadministration of multiple doses of moderate CYP3A inhibitors FLUCONAZOLE and DILTIAZEM in patients with B -cell malignancies resulted in increased zanubrutinib exposures by 1.88 -fold and 1.62-fold for dose -normalized AUC
0-24h and 1.81-fold and 1.62- fold for dose -normalized C max, respectively. 
> Simulations using fasted conditions suggested that the mild CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., CYCLOSPORINE and FLUVOXAMINE) may increase the AUC of zanubrutinib by <1.5-fold. No dose adjustment is required in combination with mild inhibitors. Monitor patients closely for toxicity and follow dose modification guidance as needed.   Grapefruit and Seville oranges should be used with caution during BRUKINSA treatment, as these contain moderate inhibitors of CYP3A (see section 4.2).
> Co-administration of multiple doses of RIFAMPIN (strong CYP3A inducer) decreased zanubrutinib Cmax by 92% and AUC by 93% in healthy subjects.  Co-administration of multiple doses of RIFABUTIN (moderate CYP3A inducer) decreased zanubrutinib C max by 48% and AUC by 44% in healthy subjects. Mild CYP3A inducers may be used with caution during BRUKINSA treatment.  Gastric acid reducing agents 
> Co-administration of multiple doses of zanubrutinib decreased MIDAZOLAM (CYP3A substrate) Cmax by 
30% and AUC by 47%. Narrow therapeutic index medicinal products that are metabolised by CYP3A (e.g., ALFENTANIL, CYCLOSPORINE, DIHYDROERGOTAMINE, ERGOTAMINE, FENTANYL, PIMOZIDE, QUINIDINE, SIROLIMUS, and TACROLIMUS) should be used with caution, as zanubrutinib may decrease the plasma exposures of these medicinal products. 
> Co-administration of multiple doses of zanubrutinib decreased OMEPRAZOLE (CYP2C19 substrate) Cmax by 20% and AUC by 36%. Narrow therapeutic index medicinal products that are metabolized by CYP2C19 (e.g., S-MEPHENYTOIN) should be used with caution, as zanubrutinib may decrease the plasma exposures of these medicinal products. 
> Co-administration of multiple doses of zanubrutinib increased DIGOXIN (P- gp substrate) C max by 34% and AUC by 11%. No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of ROSUVASTATIN (BCRP substrate) were observed when co- administered with zanubrutinib. 
> The coadministration of oral P-gp substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., DIGOXIN) should be done with caution as zanubrutinib may increase their concentrations.
