> In vitro  studies indicate that bortezomib is a weak inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes 
1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4. Based on the limited contribution (7%) of CYP2D6 to the metabolism of bortezomib, the CYP2D6 poor metaboliser phenotype is not expected to affect the overall disposition of bortezomib.  A drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of KETOCONAZOLE, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib ( injected intravenously ), showed a mean bortezomib AUC increase of 
35% (CI
90% [1.032 to 1.772]) based on data from 12 patients. Therefore, patients should be closely monitored when given bortezomib in combination with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. KETOCONAZOLE, RITONAVIR). 13  In a drug-drug interaction study assessing the effect of OMEPRAZOLE, a potent CYP2C19 inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib ( injected intravenously ), there was no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib based on data from 17 patients. 
> A drug- drug interaction study assessing the effec t of rifampicin, a potent CYP3A4 inducer, on the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib ( injected intravenously ), showed a mean bortezomib AUC reduction of 45% based on data from 6 patients. Therefore, the concomitant use of bortezomib with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampicin, CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENYTOIN, PHENOBARBITAL and St. Johnâ€™s Wort) is not recommended, as efficacy may be reduced. 
> A drug- drug interaction study assessing the effect of MELPHALAN -PREDNISONE on the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib (injected intravenously) , showed a mean bortezomib AUC increase of 17% based on data from 21 patients. This is not considered clinically relevant.
