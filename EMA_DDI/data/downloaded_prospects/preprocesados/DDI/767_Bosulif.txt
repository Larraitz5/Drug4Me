> The concomitant use of BOSUTINIB with strong CYP3A inhibitors (including, but not limited toitraconazole, KETOCONAZOLE, POSACONAZOLE , VORICONAZOLE, CLARITHROMYCIN, TELITHROMYCIN, NEFAZODONE,MIBEFRADIL, INDINAVIR, LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR, NELFINAVIR, RITONAVIR ,SAQUINAVIR ,BOCEPREVIR, TELAPREVIR , grapefruit products including GRAPEFRUIT JUICE) or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (including, but n ot limited to FLUCONAZOLE, CIPROFLOXACIN, ERYTHROMYCIN, DILTIAZEM, VERAPAMIL ,AMPRENAVIR, ATAZANAVIR,DARUNAVIR/RITONAVIR, FOSAMPRENAVIR, APREPITANT, CRIZOTINIB, IMATINIB ) should be avoided, as an increase in BOSUTINIB plasma concentration will occur .Caution should be exercised if mild CYP3A inhibitors are used concomitantly with BOSUTINIB .Selection of an alternate concomitant medicinal product with no or minimal CYP3A enzyme inhibition potential, if possible, is recommended.If a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor must be administered during BOSUTINIB treatment, an interruption of BOSUTINIB therapy or a dose reduction in BOSUTINIB should be considered.In a study of 24 healthy subjects in whom 5daily doses of 400 mgketoconazole (a strong CYP3A inhibitor) were co -administered with a single dose of 100 mgbosutinib under fasting conditions, KETOCONAZOLE increased BOSUTINIB C maxby 5.2 -fold, and BOSUTINIB AUC in plasma by 8.6 -fold, as compared with administration of BOSUTINIB alone.In a study of 20 healthy subjects ,in wh oma single dose of 125 mg APREPITANT (a moderate CYP3A inhibitor) was co -administered with a single dose of 500 mg BOSUTINIB under fed conditions , APREPITANT increased BOSUTINIB C maxby 1.5 -fold, and BOSUTINIB AUC i n plasma by 2.0 -fold, as compared with administration of BOSUTINIB alone .CYP3A inducers The concomitant use of BOSUTINIB with strong CYP3A inducers (including, but not limited tocarbamazepine, PHENYTOIN , rifampicin, St. Johnâ€™s Wort) ,or moderate CYP3A inducers (including, but not limited to BOSENTAN, EFAVIRENZ, ETRAVIRINE, MODAFINIL, NAFCILLIN) should be avoided , as a de crease in BOSUTINIB plasma concentration willoccur.Based on the large reduction in BOSUTINIB exposure that occurred when bosu tinib was co -administered with rifampicin , increasing the dose of BOSUTINIB when co -administering with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers is unlikely to sufficiently compensate for the loss of exposure.9Caution is warranted if mild CYP3A inducers are used concomitantly with BOSUTINIB . Following concomitant administration of a single dose BOSUTINIB with 6daily doses of 600 mg rifampicin ,in 24 healthy subjects in fed state BOSUTINIB exposure (C maxand
> AUC inplasma) decreased to 14% and 6%, respectively, of the values when BOSUTINIB 500mg was administered alone.PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS (PPIS)Caution should be exercised when administering BOSUTINIB concomitantly with PPIS. Short -acting ANTACIDS should be cons idered as an alternative to PP Is and administration times of BOSUTINIB and ANTACIDS should be separated (i .e.take BOSUTINIB in the morning and ANTACIDS in the evening) whenever possible. BOSUTINIB displays p
> H -dependent aqueous solubility in vitro . When a single oral do se of bosutin ib(400mg)was co -administered with multiple -oral doses of LANSOPRAZOLE (60mg) in a study of 
24healthy fasting subjects, BOSUTINIB C maxand AUC decreased to 54% and 74%, respectively, of the values seen when BOSUTINIB (400mg)was given alone.Effects of BOSUTINIB on other medicinal products
> In a study of 27 healthy subjects ,in wh oma single dose of 500 mg BOSUTINIB was co -administered with a single dose of 150 mg DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE mesylate (a P -glycoprotein [P-gp]substrate ) under fed conditions , BOSUTINIB did not increase C maxor AUC of DABIGATRAN in plasma, as compared with administration of DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE mesylate alone. The study results indicate that BOSUTINIB doesnot exhibit clinically relevant P-gpinhibitor yeffects. An in vitro study indicates that drug -drug interactions are unlikely to occur at therapeutic doses as a result of induction by BOSUTINIB on the metabolism of medicinal product s that are substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, an d CYP3A4.In vitro studies indicate that clinical drug -drug interactions are unlikely to occur at therapeutic dosesas a result of inhibition by BOSUTINIB on the metabolism of medicinal product s that are substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5.In vitro studies indicate that BOSUTINIB has a low potential to inhibit breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, systemically), organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1, OATP1B3, organic anion transporter (OAT)1, OAT3, organic cation transporter ( OCT)2 at clinically relevant concentrations, but may have the potential to inhibit BCRP in the gastrointestinal tract and OCT1.Anti-arrhythmic medicinal products and other substances that may prolong QT BOSUTINIB should be u sed with caution in patients who have or may develop prolongation of QT, including those patients taking anti -arrhythmic medicinal products such as AMIODARONE, DISOPYRAMIDE, PROCAINAMIDE, QUINIDINE and SOTALOL or other medicinal products that may lead to Q T prolongation such as CHLOROQUINE, HALOFANTRINE, CLARITHROMYCIN, DOMPERIDONE ,HALOPERIDOL, METHADONE ,and MOXIFLOXACIN (see section 4.4).
