> Complex or unknown mechanisms of drug interaction preclude extrapolation of rit onavir drug interactions to certain COBICISTAT drug interactions. The recommendations given for concomitant use of ATAZANAVIR and other medicinal products may, therefore, differ depending on whether ATAZANAVIR is boosted with RITONAVIR or COBICISTAT. In pa rticular, ATAZANAVIR boosted with COBICISTAT is more sensitive for CYP3A induction (see section 4.3 and the interaction table). Caution is also required during the first time of treatment if switching the pharmacoenhancer from RITONAVIR to COBICISTAT (see section  4.4).
> Concomitant use contraindicated  Co-adminis tration of EVOTAZ with medicinal products that are strong inducers of CYP3A (such as CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENOBARBITAL, PHENYTOIN, rifampicin, and St. John’s wort [ Hypericum  perforatum ]) may result in decreased plasma concentrations of ATAZANAVIR and/or COBICISTAT, leading to loss of therapeutic effect and possible development of resistance to ATAZANAVIR (see section  4.3 and Table 1). 
> 9 Concomitant use not recommended  Co-administration of EVOTAZ with medicinal products containing RITONAVIR or COBICISTAT, which ar e strong inhibitors of CYP3A, may result in additional boosting and increased plasma concentration of ATAZANAVIR. 
> Co-administration of EVOTAZ with medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A may result in increased plasma concentration of ATAZANAVIR and/or COBICISTAT. Some examples include, but are not limited to, ITRACONAZOLE, KETOCONAZOLE and VORICONAZOLE (see Table 1).
> Co-administration of EVOTAZ with medicinal products that are moderate to weak inducers of CYP3A may result in decreased plasma concentration of ATAZANAVIR and/or COBICISTAT, leading to loss of therapeutic effect and possible development of resistance to ATAZANAVIR. Some examples include, but are not limited to ETRAVIRINE, NEVIRAPINE, EFAVIRENZ, FLUTICASONE and BOSENTAN (see Table 1).
> ATAZANAVIR is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and UGT1A1. ATAZANAVIR is a weak to moderate inhibitor of CYP2C8. ATAZANAVIR has been shown in vivo  not to induce its own metabolism, nor to increase the biotransformation of some medicinal products metabolised by CYP3A4.  COBICISTAT is a strong mechanism -based CYP3A inhibitor and a weak CYP2D6 inhibitor. COBICISTAT inhibits the transporters p-glycoprotein (P-gp), BCRP, MATE1, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. COBICISTAT is not expected to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19. COBICISTAT is not expected to induce CYP3A4 or P-gp. Unlike RITONAVIR, COBICISTAT is not an inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or UGT1A1.
> Concomitant use cont raindicated Co-administration of medicinal products that are substrates of CYP3A and have narrow therapeutic indeces and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events are contraindicated with EVOTAZ. These medicinal products include ALFUZOSIN, AMIODARONE, ASTEMIZOLE, BEPRIDIL, CISAPRIDE, COLCHICINE, DRONEDARONE, ergot deriviatives (e.g. DIHYDROERGOTAMINE, ergometrine, ERGOTAMINE, METHYLERGONOVINE), LOMITAPIDE, LOVASTATIN, orally administered MIDAZOLAM, PIMOZIDE, QUETIAPINE, QUINIDINE, LURASIDONE, SIMVASTATIN, SILDENAFIL (when used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension), AVANAFIL, systemic LIDOCAINE, TICAGRELOR, TERFENADINE and TRIAZOLAM. 
> Co-administration of EVOTAZ with GRAZOPREVIR -containing products , including ELBASVIR/GRAZOPREVIR fixed dose combination (used to treat chronic hepatitis C infection) is contraindicated because of the increase in GRAZOPREVIR and ELBASVIR plasma concentrations and potential for the increase in risk of ALT elevations associated with the increase in GRAZOPREVIR concentrations (see section  4.3 and Table  1). Co-administration of EVOTAZ with GLECAPREVIR/PIBRENTASVIR fixed dose combination is contraindicated because of the potential increase in the risk of ALT elevations due to  a significant increase in GLECAPREVIR and PIBRENTASVIR plasma concentrations (see section  4.3).
> Increased plasma concentrations of medicinal products that are metabolised by CYP3A, CYP2C8, CYP2D6 and/or UGT1A1 are expected when co-administered with EVOTA Z. Co -administration of EVOTAZ in patients receiving medicinal products that are substrates of the transporters P -gp, BCRP, MATE1, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 may result in increased plasma concentrations of the co-administered medicinal products (see section  4.4). Co-administration with DABIGATRAN, a substrate of P-gp, is contraindicated. Clinically significant interactions between EVOTAZ and substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 are not expected.
> Interactions between EVOTAZ and other medicinal products are listed in Table 1 below (increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”). The recommendations shown in Table  1 are based on either drug interaction trials of unboosted ATAZANAVIR, ATAZANAVIR boosted with ritona vir, 10 COBICISTAT or predicted interactions due to the expected magnitude of the interaction and potential for serious adverse reactions or loss of therapeutic effect of EVOTAZ. If available, 90%  confidence intervals (CI) are shown in parentheses. The studies presented in Table 1 were conducted in healthy subjects unless otherwise noted.

* Effect of ATAZANAVIR and RITONAVIR on the first dose of GLECAPREVIR and PIBRENTASVIR is reported.  Contraindicated because of the potential increase in the risk of ALT elevations due to a significant increase in GLECAPREVIR and PIBRENTASVIR plasma concentrations (see section  4.3) ANTI -RETROVIRALS  PROTEASE INHIBITORS:  EVOTAZ in combination with other PROTEASE INHIBITORS is not recommended because co -administration may not provide adequate protease inhibitor exposure.  INDINAVIR  INDINAVIR is associated with indirect unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia due to inhibition of UGT.  Co-administration of EVOTAZ and INDINAVIR is not recommended (see section  4.4).  Nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)  LAMIVUDINE 150  mg twice  daily + ZIDOVUDINE 
300 mg twice  daily  (ATAZANAVIR 400  mg once  daily)  No significant effect on LAMIVUDINE and ZIDOVUDINE concentrations was observed when co- administered with ATAZANAVIR.  Based on these data and because COBICISTAT is not expected to have a significant impact on the pharmacokinetics of NRTIs, the co-administration of EVOTAZ with these medicinal products is not expected to significantly alter the exposure of the co- administered medicinal products.  13 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co-administration  DIDANOSINE (buffered tablets)

> Co-administration of TENOFOVIR DF with COBICISTAT is expected to increase TENOFOVIR plasma concentrations. 
> The mechanism of interaction between ATAZANAVIR and TENOFOVIR DF is unknown.  TENOFOVIR  DF may decrease the AUC and C min of ATAZANAVIR. W hen co-administered with TENOFOVIR DF, it is recommended that EVOTAZ and TENOFOVIR DF 300 mg be given together with food. ATAZANAVIR increases TENOFOVIR concentrations. Higher concentrations could potentiate TENOFOVIR -associated adverse reactions, includin g renal disorders. Patients receiving TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL should be monitored for TENOFOVIR -associated adverse reactions.  TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE 10  mg once daily/EMTRICITABINE

> The mechanism of interaction between EFAVIRENZ and ATAZANAVIR, or EFAVIRENZ and COBICISTAT is CYP3A4 induction by EFAVIRENZ.  ETRAVIRINE  Co-administration of ETRAVIRINE and EVOTAZ is expected to decrease ATAZANAVIR and COBICISTAT plasma concentrations. 
> The mechanism of interaction is CYP3A4 induction by ETRAVIRINE.  EVOTAZ is not recommended for co-administration with ETRAVIRINE because it may result in the loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance to ATAZANAVIR.  16 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co-administration  NEVIRAPINE 200  mg twice  daily (ATAZANAVIR  300 mg once  daily with RITONAVIR 100 mg once  daily) 
> Co-administration of NEVIRAPINE and COBICISTAT is expected to decrease COBICISTAT plasma concentrations while NEVIRAPINE plasma concentrations may be increased. 
> The mechanism of interaction is CYP3A4 induction by NEVIRAPINE and CYP3A4 inhibition by ATAZANAVIR and COBICISTAT.  Co-administration of EVOTAZ and NEVIRAPINE is not recommended and may result in a loss of therapeutic effect of EVOTAZ and development of resistance to atazan avir. Co -administration of NEVIRAPINE and EVOTAZ is expected to increase NEVIRAPINE plasma concentrations which may increase the risk of NEVIRAPINE -associated toxicity (see section  4.4). RILPIVIRINE  EVOTAZ is expected to increase RILPIVIRINE plasma concen trations. 
> The mechanism of interaction is CYP3A inhibition.  Co-administration of EVOTAZ and RILPIVIRINE can be used without dose adjustments, as the expected increase in RILPIVIRINE concentrations is not considered clinically relevant.  Integrase Inhibitors  DOLUTEGRAVIR  Co-administration with EVOTAZ is expected to increase DOLUTEGRAVIR plasma concentrations. DOLUTEGRAVIR is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of EVOTAZ.

No dose adjustment is required for RALTEGRAVIR if co -administered with EVOTAZ.  17 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co-administration  CCR5 Antagonists  MARAVIROC  MARAVIROC is a substrate of CYP3A and its plasma concentration increases when co-administered with potent CYP3A inhibitors. 
> CLARITHROMYCIN may increase concentrations of ATAZANAVIR and COBICISTAT. Exposure to CLARITHROMYCIN is expected to increase if co -administered with EVOTAZ. 
> The mechanism of interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition by ATAZANAVIR and/or COBICISTAT and CLARITHROMYCIN.  Alternative ANTIBIOTICS should be considered.  18 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co-administration  ANTIDIABETICS  METFORMIN  COBICISTAT reversibly inhibits MATE1, and concentrations of METFORMIN may be increased when co-administered with EVOTAZ.  Careful patient monitoring and dose adjustment of METFORMIN is recommended in patients who are taking EVOTAZ.  ANTIFUNGALS  KETOCONAZOLE 200  mg once  daily  (ATAZANAVIR 400  mg once  daily)  No significant effect on ATAZANAVIR concentrations was observed.  Caution is warranted. Specific dosing recommendations are not available for co -administration of EVOTAZ with either KETOCONAZOLE or ITRACONAZOLE.  If co-administration is required, the daily dose of KETOCONAZOLE or ITRACONAZOLE should not exceed 
200 mg. ITRACONAZOLE  ITRACONAZOLE, like KETOCONAZOLE, is a potent inhibitor as well as a substrate of CYP3A4. 
> Concentrations of KETOCONAZOLE, ITRACONAZOLE, and/or COBICISTAT may be increased with co-administration of KETOCONAZOLE or ITRACONAZOLE with EVOTAZ. 
> The mechanism of interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition by ATAZANAVIR, COBICISTAT and KETOCONAZOLE or ITRACONAZOLE.  VORICONAZOLE  Effects unknown  VORICONAZOLE should not be co-administered with EVOTAZ unless the benefit/risk assessment justifies the use of VORICONAZOLE (see section  4.4). Clinical monitoring may be needed upon co-administration with EVOTAZ.  FLUCONAZOLE 200  mg once  daily  (ATAZANAVIR 300  mg and RITONAVIR 100 mg once  daily)  ATAZANAVIR and FLUCONAZOLE concentrations were not significantly modified when ATAZANAVIR/RITONAVIR was co-administered with FLUCONAZOLE.

25-O-desacetyl -RIFABUTIN AUC ↑119% (↑78% ↑169%).  Co-administration of EVOTAZ and RIFABUTIN is not recommended. If the combination is needed, the recommended dose of RIFABUTIN is 
150 mg 3  times per week on set days (for example Monday- Wednesday- Friday). Increased monitoring for RIFABUTIN -associated adverse reactions including neutropenia and uveitis is warranted due to an expected increase in exposure to RIFABUTIN. Further dosage reduction of RIFABUTIN to 150 mg twice weekly on set days is recommended for patients in whom the 150 mg dose 3 times per week is not tolerated. It should be kept in mind that the twice weekly dosa ge of 150 mg may not provide an optimal exposure to RIFABUTIN thus leading to a risk of rifamycin resistance and a treatment failure.  Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate treatment of tuberculosis in HIV-infected patien ts.

When co-administering with EVOTAZ, titrate the DIGOXIN dose and monitor DIGOXIN concentrations. The lowest dose of DIGOXIN should initial ly be prescribed.  ANTIHYPERTENSIVES  METOPROLOL  TIMOLOL  Concentrations of beta-blockers may be increased when co-administered with EVOTAZ. 
>  26 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co-administration  CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS  BEPRIDIL  EVOTAZ must not be used in combination with medicinal products that are substrates of CYP3A4 and have a narrow therapeutic index.  Co-administration with BEPRIDIL is contraindicated (see section  4.3). DILTIAZEM 180  mg once  daily  (ATAZANAVIR 400  mg once  daily)  DILTIAZEM AUC ↑125% (↑109% ↑141%)  DILTIAZEM C max ↑98% (↑78% 
↑119%)  DILTIAZEM C min ↑142% (↑114% ↑173%) 
> No significant effect on ATAZANAVIR concentrations was observed. There was an increase in the maximum PR interval compared to ATAZANAVIR alone. 
> The mechanism of interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition by ATAZANAVIR and COBICISTAT.  Exposure to DILTIAZEM and a metabolite, desacetyl -DILTIAZEM, is increased when DILTIAZEM is co-administered with ATAZANAVIR, a component of EVOTAZ. An initia l dose reduction of DILTIAZEM by 50% should be considered, and electrocardiogram monitoring is recommended.  AMLODIPINE  FELODIPINE  NICARDIPINE  NIFEDIPINE  VERAPAMIL  Concentrations of these CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS may be increased when co-administered with EVOTAZ. 
> Clinical monitoring of therapeutic effect and adverse events is recommended when these medicinal products are co-administered with EVOTAZ.  Endothelin Receptor Antagonists  BOSENTAN  Co-administration of BOSENTAN with COBICISTAT may lead to decreased COBICISTAT plasma concentrations. 
> The mechanism of interaction is induction of CYP3A4 by BOSENTAN.  ATAZANAVIR plasma concentrations may decrease as a consequence of a reduction in COBICISTAT plasma concentrations, which may result in loss of the rapeutic effect and development of resistance. 
> Co-administration is not recommended (see section  4.4). 27 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co-administration  CORTICOSTEROIDS  DEXAMETHASONE and other CORTICOSTEROIDS metabolized by CYP3A.  Co-administration with DEXAMETHASONE or other CORTICOSTEROIDS (all routes of administration) that induce CYP3A may result in loss of therapeutic effect of EVOTAZ and development of resistance to ATAZANAVIR. 
> The mechanism of interaction is CYP3A4 induction by DEXAMETHASONE and CYP3A4 inhibition by ATAZANAVIR and/or COBICISTAT.  Co-administration with CORTICOSTEROIDS that are metabolized by CYP3A, particularly for long- term use, may increase the risk for development of systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression. The potential benefit of treatment versus the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects should be considered. 
> Plasma concentrations of these medicinal products may be increased when co –administered with EVOTAZ, resulting in reduced serum cortisol concentrations.  Concomitant use of EVOTAZ and CORTICOSTEROIDS that are metabolised by CYP3A (e.g. FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE or other inhaled or nasal CORTICOSTEROIDS) may increase the risk of development of systemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression. 
> Co-administration with CYP3A -metabolised CORTICOSTEROIDS  is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk, in which case patients should be monitored for systemic corticosteroid effects. Alternative CORTICOSTEROIDS which are less dependent on CYP3A metabolism, e.g. BECLOMETHASONE for intranasal or inhalational use, should be considered, particularly for long-term use.  28 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co-administration  ANTIDEPRESSANTS  OTHER ANTIDEPRESSANTS:  TRAZODONE  Plasma concentrations of TRAZODONE may be increased when co- administered with EVOTAZ. 
> The mechanism of interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition by ATAZANAVIR and COBICISTAT.  If TRAZODONE is co -administered with EVOTAZ, the combination should be used with caution and a lower dose of TRAZODONE should be considered.  ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION  PDE5 Inhibitors  SILDENAFIL  TADALAFIL  VARDENAFIL  AVANAFIL  SILDENAFIL, TADALAFIL, and VARDENAFIL are metabolised by CYP3A4. Co-administration with EVOTAZ may result in increased concentrations of the PDE5 inhibitor and an increase in PDE5 -associated adverse events, including hypotension, visual changes, and priapism. 
> The combination of AVANAFIL and EVOTAZ is contraindicated (see section 4.3).
> Also see PULMONARY ATERIAL HYPERTENSION in this table for further information regarding co- administration of EVOTAZ with SILDENAFIL.  29 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co-administration  HERBAL PRODUCTS  St. John’s wort  (Hypericum perforatum ) Concomitant use of ST. JOHN'S WORT with EVOTAZ may be expected to result in significant reduction in plasma levels of COBICISTAT and ATAZANAVIR. This effect may be due to an induction of CYP3A4. There is a risk of loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance to ATAZANAVIR (see section  4.3). Co-administration of EVOTAZ with products containing ST. JOHN'S WORT is contraindicated (see section  4.3). HORMONAL CONTRACEPTIVES  Progestin/estrogen  Concentrations of ETHINYL ESTRADIOL and NORETHINDRONE are increased when a combined oral contraceptive containing those agents is co-administered with ATAZANAVIR. The mechanism of interaction is inhibition of metabolism by ATAZANAVIR. 
> Effects of co -administration of EVOTAZ on progestin and estrogen are unknown.  Co-administration of EVOTAZ and  hormonal contraceptives should be avoided. An alternate (non- hormonal) reliable method of contraception is recommended.  DROSPIRENONE/ethinyloestradiol 3 mg/0.02 mg  single dose  (ATAZANAVIR 300  mg once daily with COBICISTAT 150 mg once daily)  DROSPIRENONE AUC:  ↑ 130%  DROSPIRENONE Cmax: ↔ DROSPIRENONE Cmin: Not calculated 
> Ethinyloestradiol AUC:  ↔ Ethinyloestradiol  Cmax: ↔ Ethinyloestradiol  Cmin: Not calculated  Plasma concentrations of DROSPIRENONE are increased following co -administration of DROSPIRENONE/ethinyloestradiol with ATAZANAVIR/COBICISTAT. If DROSPIRENONE/ethinyloestradiol is co-administered with ATAZANAVIR/COBICISTAT clinical monitoring is recommended due to the potential for hyperkalemia.  LIPID -MODIFYING AGENTS  LOMITAPIDE  The co -administration of LOMITAPIDE with any of the components of EVOTAZ has not been studied. 
> LOMITAPIDE is highly dependent on CYP3A4 for its metabolism and co-administration with EVOTAZ may result in increased concentrations of LOMITAPIDE.  There is a potential for risk of markedly increased transaminase levels and hepatotoxicity associated with increased plasma concentrations of LOMITAPIDE. 
> Co-administration of LOMITAPIDE with EVOTAZ is contraindicate d (see section  4.3).  30 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co-administration  HMG -Co
> A reductase inhibitors  SIMVASTATIN  LOVASTATIN  SIMVASTATIN and LOVASTATIN are highly dependent on CYP3A4 for their metabolism and co-administration with EVOTAZ may result in increased concentrations.  Co-administration of SIMVASTATIN or LOVASTATIN with EVOTAZ is contraindicated due to an increased risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis (see section  4.3).  ATORVASTATIN 10  mg single dose  (ATAZANAVIR 300  mg once daily with COBICISTAT 150 mg once daily)  ATORVASTATIN AUC:  ↑ 822%  ATORVASTATIN Cmax: ↑ 1785%  ATORVASTATIN Cmin: Not calculated 
> ATAZANAVIR AUC ↓5%  ATAZANAVIR C max ↓7%  ATAZANAVIR C min ↓10%  Plasma concentrations of ATORVASTATIN are increased when co -administered with ATAZANAVIR/COBICISTAT 
> Co-administration of ATORVASTATIN with EVOTAZ is not recommended.  PRAVASTATIN  FLUVASTATIN  PITAVASTATIN  Although not studied, there is a potential for an increase in PRAVASTATIN or FLUVASTATIN exposure when co-administered with prote ase inhibitors.  PRAVASTATIN is not metabolised by CYP3A4. FLUVASTATIN is partially metabolised by CYP2C9.
> Plasma concentrations of PITAVASTATIN may be increased if co -administered with EVOTAZ.  Caution should be exercised.  ROSUVASTATIN (10  mg single dose)  (ATAZANAVIR 300  mg once daily with COBICISTAT 150 mg once daily)  ROSUVASTATIN AUC: ↑ 242%  ROSUVASTATIN C max: ↑ 958%  ROSUVASTATIN C min: Not calculated 
> ATAZANAVIR AUC: ↔  ATAZANAVIR C max:↔ ATAZANAVIR C min: ↑ 6%  Plasma concentrations of ROSUVASTATIN are increased when co -administered with ATAZANAVIR/COBICISTAT. 
> When co -administration is necessary, do not exceed 10 mg ROSUVASTATIN daily, and clinical monitoring for safety (e.g., myopathy) is recommended.  INHALED BETA AGONISTS  SALMETEROL  Co-administration with EVOTAZ may result in increased concentrations of SALMETEROL and an increase in SALMETEROL -associated adverse events. 
> The mechanism of interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition by ATAZANAVIR and COBICISTAT.  Co-administration of sal meterol with EVOTAZ is not recommended (see section  4.4). 31 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co-administration  ERGOT DERIVATES  DIHYDROERGOTAMINE  Ergometrine ERGOTAMINE  METHYLERGONOVINE  EVOTAZ must not be used in combination with medicinal products that are substrates of CYP3A4 and have a narrow therapeutic index.  Co-administration of EVOTAZ and these ergot derivates is contraindicated (see section  4.3).
 NEUROLEPTICS  PERPHENAZINE  RISPERIDONE  THIORIDAZINE  Co-administration of neuroleptics with EVOTAZ may result in increased plasma concentrations of neuroleptics. 
> The mechanism of interaction is inhibition of CYP3A4 and/or CYP2D6 by ATAZANAVIR and/or COBICISTAT.  A decrease in the dose of neuroleptics metabolized by CYP3A or CYP2D6 may be required when co- administered with EVOTAZ.  OPIOIDS  BUPRENORPHINE, once  daily, stable maintenance dose  (ATAZANAVIR 300  mg once  daily with RITONAVIR 100 mg once  daily)  BUPRENORPHINE AUC ↑67%  BUPRENORPHINE C max ↑37%  BUPRENORPHINE C min ↑69% 
> Concentrations of ATAZANAVIR were not significantly affected.  Co-administration warrants clinical monitoring for sedation and cognitive effects. A dos e reduction of BUPRENORPHINE may be considered.  BUPRENORPHINE/NALOXONE in combination with COBICISTAT  BUPRENORPHINE AUC: ↑35%  BUPRENORPHINE C max: ↔ BUPRENORPHINE C min: ↑66 %
> The mechanism of interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition by COBICISTAT.  32 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co-administration  METHADONE, stable maintenance dose  (ATAZANAVIR 400  mg once  daily)  No significant effect on METHADONE concentrations was observed when co-administered with ATAZANAVIR. Given that COBICISTAT has been shown to have no significant effect on METHADONE concentrations, no interaction is expected if METHADONE is co-administered with EVOTAZ.  No dosage adjustment is necessary if METHADONE is co -administered with EVOTAZ.  PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION  PDE5 Inhibitors  SILDENAFIL  Co-administration with EVOTAZ may result in increased concentrations of the PDE5 inhibitor and an increase in PDE5  inhibitor -associated adverse events. 
> The mechanism of interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition by ATAZANAVIR and COBICISTAT.  A safe and effective dose in combination with EVOTAZ has not been established for SILDENAFIL when used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension. SILDENAFIL, when used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, is contraindicated (see section  4.3).  SEDATIVES/HYPNOTICS  MIDAZOLAM  TRIAZOLAM  MIDAZOLAM and TRIAZOLAM are extensively metabolized by CYP3A4. Co- administration with EVOTAZ may cause a large increase in the concentration of these benzodiazepines. Based on data for other CYP3A4 inhibitors, plasma concentrations of MIDAZOLAM are expected to be significantly higher when MIDAZOLAM is given orally. Data from concomitant use of parenteral MIDAZOLAM with other PROTEASE INHIBITORS suggest a possible 3- 4-fold increase in MIDAZOLAM plasma levels.  EVOTAZ should not be co-administered with TRIAZOLAM or orally administered MIDAZOLAM (see section  4.3), whereas caution should be used with co-administration of EVOTAZ and parenteral MIDAZOLAM. If EVOTAZ is co-administered with parenteral midazo lam, it should be done in an intensive care unit (ICU) or similar setting which ensures close clinical monitoring and appropriate medical management in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation. Dosage adjustment for MIDAZOLAM should be cons idered, especially if more than a single dose of MIDAZOLAM is administered.  33 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co-administration  BUSPIRONE  CLORAZEPATE DIAZEPAM  ESTAZOLAM  FLURAZEPAM  ZOLPIDEM  Concentrations of these sedatives/hypnotics may be increased when co-administered with EVOTAZ. 
> GASTROINTESTINAL MOTILITY AGENTS  CISAPRIDE  EVOTAZ must not be used in combination with medicinal products that are substrates of CYP3A4 and have a narrow therapeutic index.  Co-administration of EVOTAZ and CISAPRIDE is contraindicated (see section  4.3).
