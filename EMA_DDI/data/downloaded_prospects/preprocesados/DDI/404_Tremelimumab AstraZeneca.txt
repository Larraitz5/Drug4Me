> The use of systemic CORTICOSTEROIDS or IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS before starting tremelim umab,except physiological dose of systemic CORTICOSTEROIDS ( â‰¤10mg/day PREDNISONE or equivalent ),is not recommended because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy oftremelim umab. However, systemic CORTICOSTEROIDS or OTHER IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS can be used afterstarting treme limumabto treat immune -related adverse reactions (see section 4.4).No formal pharmacokinetic (PK) drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with tremelim umab.Since the primary elimination pathways of tremelimu mab are protein catabolism via reticuloendothelial system or target -mediated disposition ,no metabolic drug -drug interactions are expected. PK drug -drug interaction sbetween tremelimumab in combination with DURVALUMAB and PLATINUM -based chemotherapy wereassessed in the POSEIDON study a nd showed no clinically meaningful PK interactions between tremelimumab, DURVALUMAB, nab-PACLITAXEL, GEMCITABINE, PEMETREXED, CARBOPLATIN or CISPLATIN in the concomitant treatment .
