> The information in this section is based on binding affinity between SUGAMMADEX and other medicinal products, non -clinical experiments, clinical studies and simulations using a model taking into account the pharmacodynamic effect of neuromuscular blocking agents and the pharmacokinetic interaction between neuromuscular blocking agents and SUGAMMADEX. Based on these data, no clinically significant pharmacodynamic interaction with other medicinal pr oducts is expected, with exception of the following:  For TOREMIFENE and FUSIDIC ACID displacement interactions could not be excluded (no clinically  relevant capturing interactions are expected).  For hormonal contraceptives a clinically relevant capturing i nteraction could not be excluded (no  
> Due to the administration of SUGAMMADEX, certain medicinal products could become less effective due to a lowering of the (free) plasma concentrations. If such a situation is observed, the clini cian is advised to consider the re -administration of the medicinal product, the administration of a therapeutically equivalent medicinal product (preferably from a different chemical class) and/or non - pharmacological interventions as appropriate. 
> The interaction between 4  mg/kg SUGAMMADEX and a progestogen was predicted to lead to a decrease in progestogen exposure (34% of Area Under the Curve ( AUC) similar to the decrease seen when a daily dose of an oral contraceptive is taken 1 2 hours too late, which might lead to a reduction in effectiveness. For oestrogens, the effect is expected to be lower. Therefore , the administration of a bolus dose of SUGAMMADEX is considered to be equivalent to one missed daily dose of oral  contraceptive steroids (either combined or progestogen only). If SUGAMMADEX is administered at the same day as an oral contraceptive is taken reference is made to missed dose advice in the package leaflet of the oral contraceptive. In the case of non -oral hormonal contraceptives, the patient must use an additional non hormonal contraceptive method for the next 7 days and refer to the advice in t he package leaflet of the product.
