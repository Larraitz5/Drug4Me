> Effect of other medicinal products on cabozantinib  CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers  Administration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor KETOCONAZOLE ( 400 mg daily for 27  days) to healthy volunteers decreased cabozantinib clearance (by  29%) and increased single -dose plasma cabozantinib exposure (AUC) by 38%. Therefore co -administration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors ( e.g., RITONAVIR, ITRACONAZOLE, ERYTHROMYCIN, CLARITHROMYCIN, GRAPEFRUIT JUICE ) with cabozantinib should be approached with caution. 
> Administration of the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin ( 600 mg daily for 31  days) to healthy volunteers increased cabozantinib clearance (4.3- fold) and decreased single -dose plasma cabozantinib exposure (AUC) by 77%. Chronic co- administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers ( e.g., PHENYTOIN, CARBAMAZEPINE, rifampicin, PHENOBARBITAL or herbal preparations containing St. John’s Wort  [Hypericum perforatum ]) with cabozantinib should therefore be avoided.   Gastric p
> H modifying agents  Co-administration of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) ESOMEPRAZOLE (40  mg daily for 6 days) with a single dose of 100 mg cabozantinib to healthy volunteers resulted in no clinically- significant effect on plasma cabozantinib exposure (AUC). No dose adjustment is indicated when gastric p
> Bile salt -sequestering agents Bile salt -sequestering agents such as CHOLESTYRAMINE and CHOLESTAGEL may interact with cabozantinib and may impact absorption (or reabsorption) resulting in potentially decreased exposure (see section 5.2). The clinical significance of these potential interactions is unknown. 
> Effect of cabozantinib on other medicinal products  The effect of cabozantinib on the pharmacokinetics of contraceptive steroids has not been investigated. As unchanged contraceptive effect may not be guaranteed, an additional contraceptive method, such as a barrier method, is recommended.  Because of high plasma protein binding levels of cabozantinib (section 5.2) a plasma protein displacement interaction with WARFARIN may be possible. In case of such combination, INR values should be monitored. 
> P-glycoprotein substrates   Cabozantinib was an inhibitor (IC 50 = 7.0 μM), but not a substrate, of P -gp transport activities in a bi-directional assay system using MDCK -MDR1 cells. Therefore, cabozantinib may have the potential to increase plasma concentrations of co -administered substrates of P -gp. Subjects should be cautioned 7 regarding taking a P -gp substrate (e.g., FEXOFENADINE, ALISKIREN, AMBRISENTAN, DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE, DIGOXIN, COLCHICINE, MARAVIROC, POSACONAZOLE, RANOLAZINE, SAXAGLIPTIN, SITAGLIPTIN, TALINOLOL, TOLVAPTAN) while receiving cabozantinib.
