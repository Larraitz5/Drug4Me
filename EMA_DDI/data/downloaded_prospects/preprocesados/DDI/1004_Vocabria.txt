> VOCABRIA injection,  in combination with RILPIVIRINE injection , is indicated for the treatment of HIV -1, therefore, the prescribing information for RILPIVIRINE injection should be consulted for associated interactions. 
> CABOTEGRAVIR is primarily metabolised by URIDINE diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase ( UGT ) 1A1 and to a lesser extent by  UGT1A9. Medicinal products which are strong inducers of UGT1A1 or UGT1A9 are expected to decrease CABOTEGRAVIR plasma concentrations leading to lack of efficacy (see section 4.3  and table 6 below ). In poor metabolizers of UGT1A1, representing a maximum clinical UGT1A1 inhibition, the mea n AUC, C max and C tau of oral CABOTEGRAVIR increased by up to 1.5- fold. The impact of an UGT1A1 inhibitor may be slightly more pronounced, however, considering the safety margins of CABOTEGRAVIR, this increase is not expected to be clinically relevant. No d osing adjustments for VOCABRIA are, therefore, recommended in the presence of UGT1A1 inhibitors  (e.g. ATAZANAVIR, ERLOTINIB, SORAFENIB) .
> No drug interaction studies have been performed with CABOTEGRAVIR injection. The drug interaction data provided in Table 6 is obtained from studies with oral CABOTEGRAVIR  (increase is indicated as “↑”, 9 decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔ ”, area und er the concentration versus time curve as “AUC”, maximum observed concentration as “C max”, concentration at end of dosing interval as “Cτ”) .
> Medicinal products by therapeutic areas  Interaction  Geometric mean change (%)  Recommendations concerning co-administration  HIV-1 Antiviral medicinal products  Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor:  ETRAVIRINE  CABOTEGRAVIR ↔ AUC ↑  1% Cmax ↑ 4% Cτ ↔ 0%
> RILPIVIRINE did not significantly change CABOTEGRAVIR plasma concentration. No dose adjustment of VOCABRIA injection is necessary when co-administered with RILPIVIRINE.  Anticonvulsants  CARBAMAZEPINE  OXCARBAZEPINE  PHENYTOIN  PHENOBARBITAL  CABOTEGRAVIR ↓ Metabolic inducers may significantly decrease CABOTEGRAVIR plasma concentration. Concomitant use is contraindicated  (see section 4.3) . ANTIMYCOBACTERIALS  Rifampicin 
> 
 CABOTEGRAVIR ↓ AUC ↓  59%  Cmax ↓ 6% Rifampicin significantly decreased CABOTEGRAVIR plasma concentration which is likely to result in loss of therapeutic effect. Dosing recommendations for co -administration of VOCABRIA with rifampicin have not been established and co- administration of VOCABRIA with rifampicin is contraindicated (see section 4.3) .
> RIFAPENTINE  CABOTEGRAVIR ↓ RIFAPENTINE may significantly decrease CABOTEGRAVIR plasma concentrations. Concomitant use is contraindicated  (see section 4.3) . RIFABUTIN 
> CABOTEGRAVIR ↓ AUC ↓  21%  Cmax ↓ 17%  Cτ ↓ 8% RIFABUTIN may decrease CABOTEGRAVIR plasma concentration. Concomitant use should be avoided.  Oral contraceptives  ETHINYL ESTRADIOL (EE) and LEVONORGESTREL (LNG)  EE ↔ AUC ↑  2% Cmax ↓ 8% Cτ ↔ 0%
