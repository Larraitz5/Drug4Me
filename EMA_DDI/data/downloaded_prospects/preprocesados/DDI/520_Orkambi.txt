> Co-administration of LUMACAFTOR/IVACAFTOR with ITRACONAZOLE, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, did not impact the exposure of LUMACAFTOR, but increased IVACAFTOR exposure by 4.3- fold. Due to the induction effect of LUMACAFTOR on CYP3A, at steady- state, the net exp osure of IVACAFTOR  when co- administered with a 7 CYP3A inhibitor  is not expected to exceed that when given in the absence of LUMACAFTOR at a dose of 
150 mg every  12 hours, the approved dose of IVACAFTOR monotherapy. 
> Co-administration of LUMACAFTOR/IVACAFTOR with rifampicin, a strong CYP3A inducer, had minimal effect on the exposure of LUMACAFTOR, but decreased IVACAFTOR exposure (AUC) by 57%. Therefore, co-administration of LUMACAFTOR/IVACAFTOR is not recommended with strong CYP3A inducers  (see sections 4.2 and 4.4) .
> LUMACAFTOR is a strong inducer of CYP3A. IVACAFTOR is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A when given as monotherapy. The net effect of LUMACAFTOR/IVACAFTOR therapy is expected to be strong CYP3A induction. Therefore, concomitant use of LUMACAFTOR/IVACAFTOR with CYP3A substrates may decrease the exposure of these substrates  (see section 4.4) .
> In vitro  studies indicated that  LUMACAFTOR has the potential to both inhibit and induce P -gp. Additionally, a clinical study with IVACAFTOR monotherapy showed that IVACAFTOR is a weak inhibitor of P-gp. Therefore, concomitant use of LUMACAFTOR/IVACAFTOR with P -gp substrates  (e.g., DIGOXIN)  may alter the exposure of these substrates. 
> Interaction with CYP2B6 and CYP2C substrates has not been investigated in vivo . In vitro  studies suggest that LUMACAFTOR has the potential to induce CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19; however, inhibition of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 has also been observed in vitro . Additionally, in vitro  studies suggest that IVACAFTOR may inhibit CYP2C9. Therefore, concomitant use of LUMACAFTOR/IVACAFTOR  may alter (i.e., either increase or decrease) the exposure of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 substrates , decrease the exposure of CYP2C19 substrates, and substantially decrease the exposure of  CYP2B6 substrates. 
> In vitro  experiments show that LUMACAFTOR is a substrate for  Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP). Co-administration of ORKAMBI with medicinal products that inhibit BCRP may increase plasma LUMACAFTOR concentration. LUMACAFTOR inhibits the organic anion transporter (OAT)  1 and 3. LUMACAFTOR and IVACAFTOR are inhibitors of BCRP. Co -administration of ORKAMBI with medicinal products that are substrates for OAT1/3 and BCRP transport may increase plasma  concentrations of such medicinal products. LUMACAFTOR and IVACAFTOR are not inhibitors of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and organic cation transporter ( OCT ) 1 and 2. IVACAFTOR is not  an inhibitor of OAT1 and OAT3.
