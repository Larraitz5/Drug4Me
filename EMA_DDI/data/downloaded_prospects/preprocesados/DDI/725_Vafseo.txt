> Co-administration with oral IRON supplements (e.g., ferric citrate, ferrous sulphate, sodium ferrous citrate), products which contain IRON, IRON-containing phosphate binders (e.g., ferric citrate, SUCROFERRIC OXYHYDROXIDE) and non- IRON-containing phosphate binders (CALCIUM ACETATE, SEVELAMER CARBONATE) decreases the exposu re (Cmax and AUC) of vadadustat.
> Co-administration with PROBENECID, an OAT1/OAT3 inhibitor, increased vadadustat AUC values almost 2 -fold. If co-administration with strong or moderate OAT1 or OAT3 inhibitors (e.g. benzylpenicillin, TERIFLUNOMIDE or p- aminohippuric acid) occurs, patients should be managed cautiously and evaluated for excessive effects of vadadustat. For potential adverse reactions and dose adjustment in case of rapid Hb rise please refer to sections 4.8 and 4.2.
> Vadadustat may increase the AUC of OAT3 substrates when co -administered. The AUC of FUROSEMIDE (40  mg) increased 2 -fold following multiple doses of VAFSEO  (600 mg once daily). Monitor for signs of excessive effects of the co -administered OAT3 substrates such as FAMOTIDINE, FUROSEMIDE, METHOTREXATE, OLMESARTAN, SITAGLIPTIN, and ZIDOVUDINE.
> Co-administration of vadadustat (600 mg) with CELECOXIB (200  mg) increased CELECOXIB Cmax and AUC 
60% and 11%, respectively. Patients receiving WARFARIN or other narrow therapeutic CYP2C9 substrates (e.g., PHENYTOIN) must therefore be managed cautiously and evaluated for excessive effects when treated with vadadustat.
