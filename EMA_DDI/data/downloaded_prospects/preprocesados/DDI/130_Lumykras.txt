> Acid-reducing agents  Co-administration of sotorasib with a PPI (OMEPRAZOLE ) or an H2 receptor antagonist  (FAMOTIDINE ) led to a decrease  in sotorasib concentrations. 
> Under fed conditions (standard -calorie moderate -fat meals), co -administration of multiple doses of OMEPRAZOLE with a single dose of 960  mg sotorasib decreased sotorasib Cmax by 65% and AUC by 57%. Co -administration of a single dose of FAMOTIDINE given 10  hours prior and 2  hours after a single dose of 960  mg sotorasib decreased sotorasib Cmax by 35% and AUC by  38%.
> Under fasted conditions, co -administration of multiple doses of OMEPRAZOLE with a single dose of 
960 mg sotorasib decreased sotorasib C max by 57% and AUC by  42%. Under fasted conditions, co-administration of repeat doses of OMEPRAZOLE with a single dose of 960  mg sotorasib and 240  m
> L of an acidic beverage (non -diet cola) decreased sotorasib  Cmax by 32% and AUC by 23%. The clinical relevance of the decreased sotorasib exposure when co -administered with OMEPRAZOLE and cola is unclear and efficacy might be reduced. 
> If co-administration of LUMYKRAS with an acid -reducing agent (such as a PPI or an H 2 receptor antagonist) is required, LUMYKRAS should be taken with an acidic beverage (such as cola). Alternatively, LUMYKRAS should be taken 4  hours before or 10  hours after administration of a local antacid. 
> CYP3A4 inhibitors  Co-administration of multiple  dose ITRACONAZOLE (a strong CYP3A4 and P -gp inhibitor) did not increase sotorasib exposures to a clinically significant extent. No dose adjustment of LUMYKRAS  is recommended when co -administered with CYP3A4 inhibitors. 
> Strong CYP3A 4 inducers  Co-administration of sotorasib with multiple doses of a strong CYP3A 4 inducer (rifamp icin) decreased sotorasib Cmax by 35% and AUC by  51%. Co-administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers  (e.g. rifampicin, CARBAMAZEPINE, ENZALUTAMIDE, MITOTANE, PHENYTOIN and St. Johnâ€™s wort)  with LUMYKRAS  is not recommended because they may decrease sotorasib exposure .
> Co-administration of sotorasib with MIDAZOLAM (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate) decreased MIDAZOLAM Cmax by 48% and AUC by  53%.
> BCRP substrates  LUMYKRAS is a weak BCRP inhibitor. Co -administration of LUMYKRAS with a BCRP substrate led to an increase in the plasma concentrations of the BCRP substrate, which may increase the effect of the substrate. 
> Co-administration of LUMYKRAS with rosuvast atin (a BCRP substrate) increased the ROSUVASTATIN Cmax by 70% and AUC by 34%. 
> Effect of sotorasib on P -gp substrates  Co-administration of sotorasib with DIGOXIN  (a P-glycoprotein [P -gp] substrate ) increased DIGOXIN Cmax by 1.9 -fold and AUC inf by 1.2 -fold of DIGOXIN administered alone . Co-administration of LUMYKRAS  with P -gp substrates with narrow therapeutic indices is not recommended. If co -administration cannot be avoided, adjust the P -gp substrate dosage in accordance with the current summary of product characteristics.
