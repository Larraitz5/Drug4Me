> In addition, by inhibiting pr otein synthesis and cell division, pegaspargase  can disturb the mechanism of action of other substances which require cell division for their effect, e.g., METHOTREXATE.  METHOTREXATE and cy tarabine can interact  differently  with On caspar : their prior admini stration can increase the action of pegaspargase synergistically. If these substances are given subsequently, the effect of pegaspargase can be weakened antagonistically. 
> The use of ONCASPAR can lead to fluctuation in  coagulation fa ctors. This can promote th e tendency to bleeding and/or thrombosis. Caution is therefore needed when anticoagulants such as COUMARIN, HEPARIN, DIPYRIDAMOLE, acetylsalicylic acid or non- steroidal anti -inflammatory me dicinal products  are given concomitantly, or when concomitant chemo therapy regimen including METHOTREXATE, DAUNORUBICIN, CORTICOSTEROIDS is administered. 
> Pegaspargase may increase the risk of glucocorticoid -induced osteonecrosis in children and adolescents when both treatments are given simultaneously, with a higher incidence seen in girls , through a potential increase in exposure of DEXAMETHASONE. (see section s 4.4 and 4.8). 
> Immediately preceding or simultaneous tre atment with VINCRISTINE can increase the toxicity of pegaspargase. Administratio n of ONCASPAR before VINCRISTINE may incr ease the neurotoxicity of VINCRISTINE. Therefore, VINCRISTINE should be given at least 12  hours prior to administration of ONCASPAR in order to minimise toxicity.
> Simultaneous vaccination with live VACCINES may increase the risk of severe infections attr ibutable to the immunosuppressive activity of pegaspargase,  the presence of  the underlying disease and combination chemot herapy (see section  4.4). Vaccination with live VACCINES should therefore be given no earlier than 3 months after termination of the entire antileukaemic treatment.
