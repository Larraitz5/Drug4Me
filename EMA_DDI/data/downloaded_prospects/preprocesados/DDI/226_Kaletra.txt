> 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction KALETRA contains LOPINAVIR and RITONAVIR, both of which are inhibitors of the P450 isoform CYP3A invitro.  Co -administration of KALETRA and medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP3A may result in increased plasma concentrations of the other medici nal product, which could increase or prolong its therapeutic and adverse reactions.  KALETRA does not inhibit CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, CYP2B6 or CYP1A2 at clinically relevant concentrations (see section 4.3).KALETRA has been shown invivo to indu ce its own metabolism and to increase the biotransformation of some medicinal products metabolised by cytochrome P450 ENZYMES (including CYP2C9 and 11CYP2C19) and by glucuronidation.  This may result in lowered plasma concentrations and potential decrease of efficacy of co -administered medicinal products.Medicinal products that are contraindicated specifically due to the expected magnitude of interaction and potential for serious adverse events are listed in section 4.3.Known and theoretical interactions with selected antiretrovirals and non -antiretroviral medicinal products are listed in the table below.

> Cmax: ↑ 3.5 -fold When given with KALETRA the recommended dose of RIFABUTIN is 
150mg 3 times per week on set days (for example Monday -Wednesday -Friday).  Increased monitoring for RIFABUTIN -associated adverse reactions including neutropenia and uveitis is warranted due to a n expected increase in exposure to RIFABUTIN.  Further dosage reduction of RIFABUTIN to 150 mg twice weekly on set days is recommended for patients in whom the 150 mg dose 3 times per week is not tolerated.  It should be kept in mind that the twice weekly dosage of 150 mg may not provide an optimal exposure to RIFABUTIN thus leading to a risk of rifamycin resistance and a treatment failure.  No dose adjustment is needed for KALETRA. 20Rifampicin LOPINAVIR:Large decreases in LOPINAVIR concentrations may be observed due to CYP3A induction by rifampicin.Co-administration of KALETRA with rifampicin is not recommended as the decrease in LOPINAVIR concentrations may in turn significantly decrease the LOPINAVIR therapeutic effect .  A dose adjustment of KALETRA 
400mg/400 mg (i.e. KALETRA 
400/100 mg + RITONAVIR 300 mg) twice daily has allowed compensating for the CYP 3A4 inducer effect of rifampicin.  However, such a dose adjustment might be associated with ALT/AST elevations and with increase in gastrointestinal disorders.  Ther efore, this co -administration should be avoided unless judged strictly necessary.  If this co-administration is judged unavoidable, increased dose of KALETRA at 400 mg/400 mg twice daily may be administered with rifampicin under close safe ty and therapeutic drug monitoring.  The KALETRA dose should be titrated upward only after rifampicin has been initiated (see section 4.4).ANTIPSYCHOTICS

> KALETRA must not be co -administered with oral MIDAZOLAM (see section 
4.3), whereas caution should be used with co -administration of KALETRA and parenteral MIDAZOLAM.  If KALETRA is co -administered with parenteral midazol am, it should be done in an intensive care unit (ICU) or similar setting which ensures close clinical monitoring and appropriate medical management in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation.  Dosage adjustment for MIDAZOLAM should be considered especially if more than a single dose of MIDAZOLAM is administered.Beta2-adrenoceptor agonist (long acting)SALMETEROL SALMETEROL:Concentrations are expected to increase due to CYP3A inhibition by LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR.The combination may result in increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events associated with SALMETEROL, including QT prolongation, palpitations and sinus tachycardia.Ther efore, concomitant administration of KALETRA with SALMETEROL is not recommended (see section 4.4).CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS

Systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression have been reported in patients receiving RITONAVIR and inhaled or intranasally administered flutic asone propionate; this could also occur with other CORTICOSTEROIDS metabolised via the P450 3A pathway e.g. BUDESONIDE and TRIAMCINOLONE.  Consequently, concomitant administration of KALETRA and these GLUCOCORTICOIDS is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 
4.4).  A dose reduction of the glucocorticoid should be considered with close monitoring of local and systemic effects or a switch to a glucocorticoid, which is not a substrate for CYP3A4 (e.g. BECLOMETHASONE).  Moreover, in case of withdrawal of GLUCOCORTICOIDS progressive dose reduction may have to be performed over a longer period.  Phosphodiesterase(PDE5) inhibitors
