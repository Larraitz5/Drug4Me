> INTERFERONS have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome  P450 -dependent ENZYMES in humans and animals. Caution should be exercised when administering REBIF in combination with medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are  largely dependent on the hepatic cytochrome  P450 system for clearance, e.g.  ANTIEPILEPTICS and some classes of ANTIDEPRESSANTS.
