> As in adults, there is no evidence of clinically significant medicinal product interactions in paediatric patients receiving up to 60  mg/kg/day levetiracetam.  A retrospective assessment of pharmacokinetic interactions in children and adolescents with epilepsy (4 to 17  years) confirmed that adjunctive therapy with orally administered levetiracetam did not influence the steady -state serum concentrations of concomitantly administered CARBAMAZEPINE and valproate. However, data suggested a 20 % higher levetiracetam clearance in children taking enzyme -inducing antiepileptic medicinal products. Dose adjustment is not required. 
> Concomitant administration of levetiracetam and METHOTREXATE has been reported to decrease methotrexa te clearance, resulting in increased/prolonged blood METHOTREXATE concentration to
