> In vitro  tafamidis inhibits the efflux transporter BCRP (breast cancer resistant protein) with IC50=1.16  ÂµM and may cause drug -drug interactions at clinically relevant concentrations with substrates of this transporter (e.g. METHOTREXATE, ROSUVASTATIN, IMATINIB).  In a clinical study in healthy participants, the exposure of the BCRP substrate ROSUVASTATIN increased approximately 2 -fold following multiple doses of 61  mg tafamidis daily dosing. 
> Tafamidis may decrease serum concentrations of total THYROXINE, without an accompanying change in free THYROXINE (T4) or THYROID stimulating ho rmone (TSH). This observation in total THYROXINE values may likely be the result of reduced THYROXINE binding to or displacement from transthyretin (TTR) due to the high binding affinity tafamidis has to the TTR THYROXINE receptor. No corresponding clinica l findings consistent with THYROID dysfunction have been observed.
