• or other inhibitors of platelet aggregation , such as  
- acetylsalicylic acid,  
- non-steroidal anti -inflammatory medicinal products,  
- non-selective PHOSPHODIESTERASE INHIBITORS like PENTOXIFYLLINE,  
- selective phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) inhibitors like CILOSTAZOL or ANAGRELIDE,  
- TICLOPIDINE,  
- CLOPIDOGREL , 
- glycoprotein  IIb/IIIa antagonists , like o ABCIXIMAB,  o EPTIFIBATIDE , o TIROFIBAN ,
