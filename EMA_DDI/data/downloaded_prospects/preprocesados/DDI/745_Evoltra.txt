>  Patients who have previously received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT) may be at higher risk for hepatotoxicity suggestive of veno- occlusive disease (VOD) following treatment with clofarabine (40  mg/m
2) when used in combination with ETOPOSIDE (100 mg/m2) and CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE (440 mg/m2). In the post -marketing period, following treatment with clofarabine, serious hepatotoxic adverse reactions of VOD in paediatric and adult patients have been associated with a fatal outcome. Cases of hepatitis and hepatic failure, including fatal outcomes, have been reported with clofarabine treatment (see section 4.8). 
> Most patients received conditioning regimens that included BUSULFAN, MELPHALAN, and/or the combination of CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE and total body irradiation. Severe hepatotoxic events have been reported in a Phase 1/2 combination study of clofarabine in paediatric patients with relapsed or refractory acute leuk aemia . 
> Clofarabine is n ot detectably metabolised by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system.  Therefore, it is unlikely to interact with active substances which inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 ENZYMES. In addition, clofarabine is unlikely to inhibit any of the major 5 human CY P isoforms (1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 
2D6 and 3A4) or to induce 2 of these isoforms (1A2 and 3A4) at the plasma concentrations achieved following intravenous infusion of 52 mg/m
2/day.  As a result, it is not expected to affect the metabolism of active substances whi ch are known substrates for these ENZYMES.  7  Clofarabine is predominately excreted via the kidneys. Thus , the concomitant use of medicinal products that have been associated with renal toxicity  and those eliminated by tubular secretion  such as NSAIDs, ampho tericin B,  METHOTREXATE , aminosides, organoplatines, FOSCARNET, PENTAMIDINE, cyclosporin, TACROLIMUS, ACYCLOVIR and VALGANCICLOVIR , should be avoided particularly during the 5 day clofarabine administration period (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.2).
