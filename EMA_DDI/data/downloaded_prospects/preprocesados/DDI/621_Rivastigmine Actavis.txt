> RIVASTIGMINE may cause increased gastric acid secretions. Care should be exercised in treating patients with active gastric  or duodenal ulcers or patients predisposed to these conditions. 
> Like other cholinomimetics, RIVASTIGMINE may exacerbate or induce extrapyramidal symptoms. Worsening (including bradykinesia, dyskinesia, gait abnormality) and an increased incidence or severity of tremor have been observed in patients with dementia associated with Parkinsonâ€™s disease (see section  4.8). These events led to the discontinuation of RIVASTIGMINE in some  cases (e.g. discontinuations due to tremor 1.7 % on RIVASTIGMINE vs . 0 % on placebo). Clinical monitoring is recommended for these adverse reactions. 
> Since bradycardia constitutes a risk factor in the occurrence of torsades de pointes, the combination of RIVASTIGMINE with QT prolongation-  or torsades de pointes -inducing medicinal products such as ANTIPSYCHOTICS i.e. some phenothiazines (CHLORPROMAZINE, LEVOMEPROMAZINE), BENZAMIDES (SULPIRIDE, sultopride, AMISULPRIDE, tiapride, veralipride), PIMOZIDE, HALOPERIDOL, DROPERIDOL, CISAPRIDE, CITALOPRAM, diphemanil, ERYTHROMYCIN IV, halofantrin, mizolastin, METHADONE, PENTAMIDINE and moxifloxacine should be observed with caution and clinical monitoring (ECG) may also be required. 
> No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between RIVASTIGMINE and DIGOXIN, w arfarin, DIAZEPAM or FLUOXETINE in studies in healthy volunteers. The increase in prothrombin time induced by WARFARIN is not affected by administration of RIVASTIGMINE. No untoward effects on cardiac conduction were observed following concomitant administ ration of DIGOXIN and RIVASTIGMINE.
