> FLUVOXAMINE  FLUVOXAMINE increases melatonin levels (by 17-fold higher AUC and a 12- fold higher serum Cmax) by inhibiting its metabolism by hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes CYP1A2 and CYP2C19.  The combination should be avoided.
> Benzodiazepines/non-benzodiazepine hypnotics  Melatonin may enhance the sedative properties of benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, such as ZALEPLON, ZOLPIDEM and ZOPICLONE.  In a clinical trial, there was clear evidence for a transitory pharmacodynamic interaction between melatonin and ZOLPIDEM one hour following co-dosing.  Concomitant administration resulted in increased impairment of attention, memory and co -ordination compared to ZOLPIDEM alon e. Combination with benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics should be avoided.  THIORIDAZINE and IMIPRAMINE  Melatonin has been co -administered in studies with THIORIDAZINE and IMIPRAMINE, active substances which affect the CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM.  No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions were found in each case.  However, melatonin co- administratio n resulted in increased feelings of tranquility and difficulty in performing tasks compared to IMIPRAMINE alone, and increased feelings of “muzzy-headedness” compared to THIORIDAZINE alone.  Combination with THIORIDAZINE and IMIPRAMINE should be avoided.
> CIMETIDINE  Caution should be exercised in patients on CIMETIDINE which is a potent inhibitor of certain cytochrome P450 (CYP450) ENZYMES, mainly CYP1A2 and thereby increases plasma melatonin levels, by inhibiting its metabolism. 
> 5 CYP1A2 inhibitors  CYP1A2 inhibitors such as quinolones (CIPROFLOXACIN  and NORFLOXACIN) may give rise to increased melatonin exposure.
