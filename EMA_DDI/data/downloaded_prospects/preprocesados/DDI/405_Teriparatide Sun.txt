> In a study of 15 healthy subjects administered digo xin daily to steady state, a single teriparatide dose did not alter the cardiac effect of DIGOXIN. Howeve r, sporadic case reports have suggested that hypercalcaemia may predispose patients to digitalis toxicity. Because teriparatide transiently increases serum CALCIUM, teriparatide sh ould be used with caution in  patients taking digitalis.
> Co-administration of RALOXIFENE or  hormone replacement therapy with  teriparatide did not alter the effects of teriparatide on serum or urine CALCIUM or on clinical adverse events.
