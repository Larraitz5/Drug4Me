> Administration of eltrombopag 75  mg once daily for 5  days with a single 10  mg dose of the OATP1B1 and BCRP substrate ROSUVASTATIN to 39  healthy adult subjects increased plasma ROSUVASTATIN C max 103% (90% confidence interval [ CI]: 82%, 126%) and AUC 0- 55% (90% CI: 42%, 69%). Interactions are also expected with other HMG -Co
> Concomitant administration of eltrombopag and  OATP1B1 (e.g. METHOTREXATE) and BCRP (e.g. TOPOTECAN and METHOTREXATE) substrates should be undertaken with caution  (see section  5.2).
> Co-administration of a single dos e of eltrombopag 200  mg with BOCEPREVIR 800  mg every 8  hours  did not alter plasma BOCEPREVIR AUC (0-), but increased C max by 20%, and decreased C min by 32%. The clinical relevance of the decrease in C min has not been established, increased clinical and laboratory monitoring for HCV suppression is recommended. 
> A decrease in eltrombopag exposure was observed with co -administration of 200  mg and 600  mg CICLOSPORIN (a BCRP inhibitor). The co -administration of 200  mg CICLOSPORIN decreased the C max and the AUC 0- of eltrombopag by 25% and 18%, respectively. The co -administration of 600  mg CICLOSPORIN decreased the C max and the AUC 0- of eltrombopag by 39% and 24%, respectively.  Eltrombopag dose adjustment is permitted during the course of the treatment based on the patient’s platelet count (see section  4.2). Platelet count should be monitored at least weekly for 2 to 3  weeks when eltr ombopag is co -administered with CICLOSPORIN. Eltrombopag dose may need to be increased based on these platelet counts.  13  Polyvalent cations (chelation) 
> Eltrombopag chelates with polyvalent cations such as IRON, CALCIUM, MAGNESIUM, ALUMINIUM, SELENIUM and ZINC. Administration of a single dose of eltrombopag 75  mg with a polyvalent cation -containing antacid (1  524 mg ALUMINIUM hydroxide and 1  425 mg MAGNESIUM carbonate) decreased plasma eltrombopag AUC 0- by 70% (90% CI: 64%, 76%) and C max by 70% (90% CI: 62%, 76%). Eltrombopag should be taken at least two hours before or four hours after any products such as ANTACIDS, dairy products or MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS  containing polyvalent cations to avoid significant reduction in eltrombopag absorption  due to chelation (see sections  4.2 and  5.2).
> Co-administration of eltrombopag with LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR may cause a decrease in the concentration of eltrombopag. A study in 40 healthy volunteers showed that the co -administration of  a single 100 mg dose of eltrombopag with repeat dose LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR  400/100  mg twice daily resulted in a reduction in eltrombopag plasma AUC 0- by 17% (90% CI: 6.6%, 26.6%). Therefore, caution should be used when co -administration of eltrombopag with LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR  takes place. Platelet count should be closely monitored in order to ensure appropriate medical management of the dose of eltrombopag when LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR therapy is initiated or discontinued. 
> Eltrombopag is metaboli sed through multiple pathways including CYP1A2, CYP2C8, UGT1A1, and UGT1A3 (see section  5.2). Medicinal products  that inhibit or induce a single enzyme are unlikely to significantly affect plasma eltrombop ag concentrations , where as medicinal products  that inhibit or induce multiple ENZYMES have the potential to increase (e.g. FLUVOXAMINE) or decrease (e.g. rifampicin) eltrombopag concentrations. 
> Medicinal products used in the treatment of ITP in combination with eltrombopag in clinical studies included CORTICOSTEROIDS, DANAZOL, and/or AZATHIOPRINE, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and anti-D immunoglobulin. Platelet counts should be monitored when combining eltrombopag with other medicinal products for the treatment of ITP in order to avoid platelet counts outside of the recommended range (see section  4.2).
> 14 Administration of a single 25  mg dose of eltrombopag as powder for oral suspension with a high -CALCIUM, m oderate -fat and moderate -calorie meal reduced plasma eltrombopag mean AUC 0-∞ by 75% and mean C max by 79%. This decrease of exposure was attenuated when a single 25  mg dose of eltrombopag powder for oral suspension was administered 2  hours before a high -CALCIUM meal (mean AUC 0-∞ was decreased by 20% and mean C max by 14%).
