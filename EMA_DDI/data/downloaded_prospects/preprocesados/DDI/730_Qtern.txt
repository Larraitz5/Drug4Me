> DAPAGLIFLOZIN may add to the diuretic effect of thiazide and LOOP DIURETICS and may increase the risk of dehydration and hypotension (see section 4.4).Use with medicinal products known to cause hypoglycaemia

No dose adjustment is recommended. A clinically relevant effect with other inducers (e.g. CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENYTOIN, PHENOBARBITAL) is not expected.Following coadministration of DAPAGLIFLOZIN with MEFENAMIC ACID (an inhibitor of UGT1A9), a 55% increase in DAPAGLIFLOZIN systemic exposure was seen, but w ith no clinically meaningful effect on 
24-hour urinary GLUCOSE excretion.Effect of SAXAGLIPTIN or DAPAGLIFLOZIN on other medicinal products
> SAXAGLIPTIN: SAXAGLIPTIN did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of METFORMIN, GLIBENCLAMIDE(a CYP2C9 substrate) , PIOGLITAZONE [a CYP2C8 (major) and CYP3A4 (minor) substrate ], DIGOXIN (a P-gpsubstrate) , SIMVASTATIN (a CYP3A4 substrate) , the active components of a combined oral contraceptive (ethinylestradiol and NORGESTIMATE), dilt iazem  or keto conazole.DAPAGLIFLOZIN: In interaction studies conducted in healthy subjects, using mainly a single -dose design, DAPAGLIFLOZIN did not alter the pharmacokinetics of METFORMIN, PIOGLITAZONE [a CYP2C8 (major) and CYP3A4 (minor) substrate] , SITAGLIPTIN, GLIMEPIRIDE (a CYP2C9 substrate) , HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE, BUMETANIDE, VALSARTAN, DIGOXIN (a P -gp substrate) or WARFARIN (S -WARFARIN, a CYP2C9 substrate), or the anticoagulatory effects of WARFARIN as measured by INR. Combination of a single dose of dapagliflo zin 
20mgand SIMVASTATIN (a CYP3A4 substrate) resulted in a 19% increase in AUC of SIMVASTATIN and 
31% increase in AUC of SIMVASTATIN acid. The increase in SIMVASTATIN and SIMVASTATIN acid exposures are not considered clinically relevant .Interference wi th 1,5 -anhydroglucitol (1,5 -AG) assay
