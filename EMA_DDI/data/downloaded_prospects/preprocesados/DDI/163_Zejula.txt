> The combination of NIRAPARIB with VACCINES or immunosuppressant agents has not been studied. 
> The data on NIRAPARIB  in combination with cytotoxic medicinal products  are limited . Therefore,  caution should be taken if NIRAPARIB is used in combination  with VACCINES, immunosuppressant agents o r with other cytotoxic medicinal products .
> NIRAPARIB is an inhibitor of MATE1 and - 2 with IC
50 of 0.18 µM and ≤  0.14 µM, respectively. Increased plasma concentrations of co -administered medicinal products that are substrates of these transporters (e.g. METFORMIN) cannot be excluded.
