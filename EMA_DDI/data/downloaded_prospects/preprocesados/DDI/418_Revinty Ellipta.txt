> Caution is advised when co -administering with strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors (e.g. KETOCONAZOLE, RITONAVIR , COBICISTAT -containing products ) as there is potential for increased systemic exposure to both FLUTICASONE FUROATE and VILANTEROL . Co-administration should be avoided unless the benefit outweighs the increased risk of systemic corticosteroid undesirable  effects, in which case patients should be monitored for systemic corticosteroid undesirable  effects . A repeat dose CYP3A4 drug interaction study was performed in healthy subjects with the FLUTICASONE FUROATE/VILANTEROL combination 9 (184/22 micrograms ) and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor KETOCONAZOLE (400  mg). Co-administration increased mean FLUTICASONE FUROATE AUC (0-24) and C max by 36% and 33%, respectively. The increase in FLUTICASONE FUROATE exposure was associated with a 27% reduction in 0- 24 hours  weighted mean serum cortisol.  Co-administration increased mean VILANTEROL AUC (0-t) and C max 65% and 22%, respectively.  The increas e in VILANTEROL exposure was not associated with an increase in beta 2-agonist related systemic effects on heart rate, blood POTASSIUM or QTc
> Concomitant administration of other sympathomimetic medicinal products (alone or as part of combination therapy) may potentiate the adverse reactions of FLUTICASONE FUROATE/VILANTEROL.  REVINTY ELLIPTA should not be used in conjunction with other long- acting beta 2-adrenergic agonists or medicinal products containing long- acting beta 2-adrenergic agonists.
