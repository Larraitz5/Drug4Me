> Strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors Co-administration of KETOCONAZOLE (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor: 200 mg twice daily) with a single dose of FEDRATINIB (300 mg) increased the FEDRATINIB area under the plasma concentration time curve from time zero to infinity ( AUC inf) by approximately 3-fold. (see section  4.2).
> Based on physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) simulations, co- administration of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, ERYTHROMYCIN (500 mg three times daily) or DILTIAZEM (120  mg twice daily), with FEDRATINIB 400 mg once daily is predicted to increase FEDRATINIB AUC at steady state by 1.1- fold. Adverse reactions following prolonged co-administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be excluded.
> Simultaneous inhibition of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19  Co-administration of FLUCONAZOLE (dual inhibitor of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, 200 mg once daily) with a single dose of FEDRATINIB (100 mg) increased AUC inf of FEDRATINIB by 1.7- fold. Based on PBPK simulations, co -administration of FLUCONAZOLE (200 mg once daily) with FEDRATINIB 
400 mg once daily is predicted to increase FEDRATINIB AUC at steady state by 1.5 -fold. Due to potential increase in exposure of FEDRATINIB, patients taking concomitant dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 may require more intensive safety monitoring and if necessary, dose modifications of INREBIC based on adverse reactions (see section  4.2).
> 9 Strong and moderate CYP3A4 inducers Co-administration of rifampicin (strong CYP3A4 inducer: 600 mg once daily) or EFAVIRENZ (moderate CYP3A4 inducer: 600 mg once daily) with a single dose of FEDRATINIB (500 mg) decreased AUC inf of FEDRATINIB by approximately 80% or 50%, respectively.
> PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS  Co-administration of PANTOPRAZOLE (proton pump inhibitor: 40  mg daily) with a single dose of FEDRATINIB (500 mg) increased FEDRATINIB AUC inf to a clinically insignificant extent (by 1.15-fold). Therefore, an increase in gastric p
> H is not expected to have clinically meaningful impact on FEDRATINIB exposure and no dose adjustment is needed for concomitant administration of FEDRATINIB  with agents that increase gastric p
> Effects  on e nzymes: CYP3A4, CYP2C19 or CYP2D6 substrates Concomitant administration of FEDRATINIB with the CYP3A4 substrate, MIDAZOLAM (2  mg), the CYP2C19 substrate, OMEPRAZOLE  (20 mg), and the CYP2D6 substrate, METOPROLOL (100 mg) , increases MIDAZOLAM, OMEPRAZOLE, and METOPROLOL AUC inf by 3.8-, 2.8-, 1.8- fold and peak concentrations ( Cmax) by 1.8-, 1.1- and 1.6-fold, respectively . Therefore, dose modifications of medicin al products that are CYP3A4, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 substrates should be made as needed with close monitoring of safety and efficacy.
> Effects on transporters  In in vitro studies , FEDRATINIB inhibits P- glycoprotein ( P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ), MATE1, MATE2 -K, organic anion transporting polypeptide  (OATP )1B1, OATP1B3 and OCT2. Co-administration of a single dose of FEDRATINIB (600 mg) with a single dose of DIGOXIN (P-gp substrate: 0.25 mg), ROSUVASTATIN (OATP1B1/1B3 and BCRP substrate: 10 mg), and METFORMIN (OCT2 and MATE1/2 -K substrate: 1000 mg) had no clinically meaningful effect on the AUC inf of DIGOXIN, ROSUVASTATIN, and METFORMIN. Renal clearance of METFORMIN was decreased by 36% in the presence of FEDRATINIB . The GLUCOSE -lowering pharmacodynamic effect of METFORMIN in the presence of FEDRATINIB appears reduced, with the GLUCOSE AUC
0-3h being 17% higher. Caution should be exercised and dose modifications should be made as needed for agents that are renally excreted via OCT2 and MATE1/2 -K.
> The concurrent use of haematopoietic growth factors and FEDRATINIB has not been studied. It is not known whether the JAK inhibition by FEDRATINIB  reduces the efficacy of haematopoietic growth factors or whether the haematopoietic growth factors affect the efficacy of FEDRATINIB (see sections 4.2 and 
4.4).
