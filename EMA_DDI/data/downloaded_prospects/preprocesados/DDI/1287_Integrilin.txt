> WARFARIN and DIPYRIDAMOLE  INTEGRILIN did not appear to increase the risk of major and minor bleeding associated with concomitant use of WARFARIN and DIPYRIDAMOLE. INTEGRILIN -treated patients who had a prothrombin time (PT) >  14.5 seconds and received warf arin concomitantly did not appear to be at an increased risk of bleeding. 
> INTEGRILIN and thrombolytic agents  Data are limited on the use of INTEGRILIN in patients receiving thrombolytic agents. There was no consistent evidence that eptifibatide increased the risk of major or minor bleeding associated with tissue plasminogen activator in either a PCI or an acute m yocardial infarction study. Eptifibatide appeared to increase the risk of bleeding when administered with STREPTOKINASE in an acute myocardial infarction study. The combination of reduced dose TENECTEPLASE and eptifibatide compared to placebo and eptifibat ide significantly  increased the risk of both major and minor bleeding when administered concomitantly in an acute ST -elevation myocardial infarction study.   6  In an acute myocardial infarction study involving 181 patients, eptifibatide (in regimens up to a b olus injection of 180 microgram/kg, followed by an infusion up to 2 microgram/kg/min for up to 72 hours) was administered concomitantly with STREPTOKINASE (1.5  million units over 60 minutes). At the highest infusion rates (1.3  microgram/kg/min and 2.0 micr ogram/kg/min) studied, eptifibatide was associated with an increased incidence of bleeding and transfusions compared to the incidence seen when STREPTOKINASE was given alone.
