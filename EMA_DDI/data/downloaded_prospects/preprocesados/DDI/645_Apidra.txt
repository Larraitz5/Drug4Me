> Studies on pharmacokinetic interactions have not been performed. Based on empirical knowledge from similar medicinal products, clinically relevant pharmacokinetic intera ctions are unlikely to occur. A number of substances affect GLUCOSE metabolism and may require dose adjustment of INSULIN GLULISINE and particularly close monitoring.  6 Substances that may enhance the blood -GLUCOSE-lowering activity and increase susceptibili ty to hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products , angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, DISOPYRAMIDE, FIBRATES, FLUOXETINE, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), PENTOXIFYLLINE, PROPOXYPHENE, salicylates and sulphonamide antibioti cs. Substances that may reduce the blood-GLUCOSE- lowering activity include CORTICOSTEROIDS, DANAZOL, DIAZOXIDE, DIURETICS, GLUCAGON, ISONIAZID, PHENOTHIAZINE DERIVATIVES, SOMATROPIN, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. EPINEPHRINE [adrenaline], SALBUTAMOL, TERBUTALINE), THYROID HORMONES, oestrogens , progestins (e.g. in oral contraceptives), PROTEASE INHIBITORS and atypical antipsychotic medicinal products (e.g. OLANZAPINE and CLOZAPINE). Beta-blockers, CLONIDINE, LITHIUM salts or alcohol may either pot entiate or weaken the blood-GLUCOSE-lowering activity of insulin. PENTAMIDINE may cause hypoglycaemia, which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. In addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, CLONIDINE, GUANETHIDINE and RESERPINE, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent.
