> Like other medicinal products containing a beta 2-adrenergic agonist, this medicinal product should be administered with caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic ANTIDEPRESSANTS or medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval, as any effect of these on the QT interval may be potentiated. Medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval may increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmia (see section s 4.4 and 5.1). 
> Concomitant hypokalaemic treatm ent with methylxanthine derivatives, steroids or non-POTASSIUM -sparing DIURETICS may potentiate the possible hypokalaemic effect of beta 2-adrenergic agonists (see section  4.4).
> Due to the very low plasma concentration achieved after inhaled dosing, clinically significant interactions with MOMETASONE furoate are unlikely. However, there may be a potential for increased systemic exposure to MOMETASONE furoate w hen strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. KETOCONAZOLE, ITRACONAZOLE, NELFINAVIR, RITONAVIR, COBICISTAT) are co -administered.
