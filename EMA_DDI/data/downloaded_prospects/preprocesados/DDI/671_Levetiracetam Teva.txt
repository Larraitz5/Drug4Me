> As in adults, there is no evidence of clinically significant medicinal product interactions in paediatric  patients receiving up to 60  mg/kg/day levetiracetam.  A retrospective assessment of pharmacokinetic interactions in children and adolescents with epilepsy (4 to 17 years) confirmed that adjunctive therapy with orally administered levetiracetam did not  influence the steady -state serum concentrations of concomitantly administered CARBAMAZEPINE and  8 valproate. However, data suggested a 20  % higher levetiracetam clearance in children taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic med icinal products. Dose adjustment is not required. 
> Concomitant administration of levetiracetam and METHOTREXATE has been reported to decrease METHOTREXATE clearance, resulting in increased/prolonged blood METHOTREXATE concentration to potentially toxic levels. Blood METHOTREXATE and levetiracetam levels should be carefully monitored in patients treated concomitantly with the two drugs.
