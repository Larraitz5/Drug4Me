> ACE inhibitors  The concomitant use of  SACUBITRIL/VALSARTAN  with ACE inhibitors is contraindicated, as the concomitant inhibition of neprilysin (NEP) and ACE may increase the risk of angioedema. SACUBITRIL/VALSARTAN must not be started until 36  hours after taking the last dose of ACE INHIBITOR therapy. ACE inhibit or therapy must not be started until 36  hours after the last dose of SACUBITRIL/VALSARTAN  (see sections  4.2 and 4.3). 
> 8 ALISKIREN  The concomitant  use of SACUBITRIL/VALSARTAN  with ALISKIREN -containing medicinal products is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or in patients with renal impairment (e
> GFR 
<60 ml/min/1.73  m2) (see section  4.3). The combination of SACUBITRIL/VALSARTAN  with direct renin inhibitors  such as ALISKIREN is not recommended (see section  4.4). Combination of SACUBITRIL/VALSARTAN  with ALISKIREN is potentially associated with a higher frequency of adverse reactions  such as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) (see sections  4.3 and 4. 4).
> OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrates, e.g. statins  In vitro  data indicate that SACUBITRIL inhibits OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 transporters. ENTRESTO may therefore increase the systemic exposure of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrates such as statins. Co-administration of SACUBITRIL/VALSARTAN  increased the C max of ATORVASTATIN and its metabolites by up to 
2-fold and AUC by up to 1.3 -fold. Caution should be exercised when co -administering SACUBITRIL/VALSARTAN  with statins.  No clinically relevant interaction was observed when SIMVASTATIN and ENTRESTO were co -administered. 
> POTASSIUM  Concomitant use of POTASSIUM -sparing DIURETICS (TRIAMTERENE, AMILORIDE), mineralocorticoid antagonists (e.g. SPIRONOLACTONE, EPLERENONE), POTASSIUM supplements, salt substitutes containing POTASSIUM or other agents (such as HEPARIN) may lead to increases in serum POTASSIUM, and to inc reases in serum creatinine. Monitoring of serum POTASSIUM is recommended if SACUBITRIL/VALSARTAN  is co-administered with these agents (see section  4.4).
> Non-steroidal anti -inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), including selective cyclooxygenase -2 (COX -2) inhibitors  In elderly patients, volume -depleted patients (including those on diuretic therapy), or patients with compromised renal function, concomitant use of SACUBITRIL/VALSARTAN  and NSAIDs may lead to an increased risk of worsening of renal function. Th erefore, monitoring of renal function is recommended when initiating or modifying treatment in patients on SACUBITRIL/VALSARTAN  who are taking NSAIDs concomitantly (see section  4.4).
> LITHIUM  Reversible increases in serum LITHIUM concentrations and toxicit y have been reported during concomitant administration of LITHIUM with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists  including SACUBITRIL/VALSARTAN . Therefore, this combination is not recommended. If the combination proves necessary, careful monito ring of serum LITHIUM levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, the risk of LITHIUM toxicity may be increased further. 
> 9 FUROSEMIDE  Co-administration of SACUBITRIL/VALSARTAN  and FUROSEMIDE had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of SACUBITRIL/valsart an but reduced C max and AUC of FUROSEMIDE by 50% and 28%, respectively. While there was no relevant change in urine volume, the urinary excretion of sodium was reduced within 
4 hours and 24  hours after co -administration. The average daily dose of FUROSEMIDE was unchanged from baseline until the end of the PARADIGM -HF study in patients treated with SACUBITRIL/VALSARTAN .
> OATP and MRP2 transporters  The active metabolite of sacub itril (LBQ657) and VALSARTAN are OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1 and OAT3 substrates; VALSARTAN is also a MRP2 substrate. Therefore, co -administration of SACUBITRIL/VALSARTAN  with inhibitors of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT3 (e.g. rifampicin, CICLOSPORIN), OAT1 (e.g. tenof ovir, CIDOFOVIR ) or M RP2 (e.g. RITONAVIR) may increase the systemic exposure of LBQ657 or VALSARTAN. Appropriate care should be exercised when initiating or ending concomitant treatment with such medicinal products. 
> METFORMIN  Co-administration of SACUBITRIL/VALSARTAN  with METFORMIN reduced both C max and AUC of METFORMIN by 
23%. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. Therefore, when initiating therapy with SACUBITRIL/VALSARTAN  in patients receiving METFORMIN, the c linical status of the patient should be evaluated. 
> No clinically meaningful interaction was observed when SACUBITRIL/VALSARTAN  was co -administered with DIGOXIN, WARFARIN, HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE, AMLODIPINE, OMEPRAZOLE, CARVEDILOL or a combination of LEVONORGESTREL/ETHINYL ESTRADIOL.
