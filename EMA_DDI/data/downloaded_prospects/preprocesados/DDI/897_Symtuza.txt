> No interaction trials have been performed using SYMTUZA . Interactions that have been identified in studies with individual components of SYMTUZA ,i.e. with DARUNAVIR (in combination with low dose RITONAVIR) ,COBICISTAT, EMTRICITABINE or TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE, determine the interactions t hat may occur with SYMTUZA .DARUNAVIR and COBICISTAT
> DARUNAVIR is an inhibitor of CYP3A, a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 and an inhibitor of P -gp. COBICISTAT is a mechanism based inhibitor of CYP3A, and a weak CYP2D6 inhibitor. COBICISTAT inhibits the transpor ters p -glycoprotein (P -gp), BCRP, MATE1, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. COBICISTAT is not expected to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19. COBICISTAT is not expected to induce CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, UGT1A1, or P -gp (MDR1).Co-administration of Symt uzaand medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP3A or transported by P -gp, BCRP, MATE1, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 may result in increased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions (see section 4.3 or table below) .SYMTUZA must not be combined with medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which increased systemic exposure is associated with serious and/or life -threatening events (nar row therapeutic index).Co-administration of Symt uzaandmedicinal products that have active metabolite(s) formed by CYP3A may result in reduced plasma concentrations of these active metabolite(s) potentially leading to loss of their therapeutic effect .These interactions are described in the interaction table below .DARUNAVIR and COBICISTAT are metabolised by CYP3A. Medicinal products that induce CYP3A activity would be expected to increase the clearance of DARUNAVIR and COBICISTAT, resulting in lowered plasma concentrations of DARUNAVIR and COBICISTAT ( e.g.EFAVIRENZ, CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENYTOIN, PHENOBARBITAL, rifampicin, RIFAPENTINE, RIFABUTIN, St .John’s Wort )(see section 4.3 and interaction table below) .Co-administration of Symt uzaand other medicina l products that inhibit CYP3A may decrease the clearance of DARUNAVIR and COBICISTAT and may result in increased plasma concentrations of DARUNAVIR and COBICISTAT ( e.g.azole antifungal s like CLOTRIMAZOLE). These interactions are described in the interacti on table below.Unlike RITONAVIR, COBICISTAT is not an inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or UGT1A1. Ifswitching from RITONAVIR as a pharmacoenhancer to this regimen with COBICISTAT , caution is required during the first two weeks of treat ment with SYMTUZA , particularly if doses of any concomitantly administered medic inal products have been titrated or adjusted during use of RITONAVIR .8Emtricitabine
> CYP -mediated interactions involving EMTRICITABINE with other medicinal products is low.EMTRICITABINE did not inhibit the glucuronidation reaction of a non -specific UGT substrate in vitro . Co-administration of EMTRICITABINE with medicinal products that a re eliminated by active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of EMTRICITABINE, and/or the co -administered medicinal product. Medicinal products that decrease renal function may increase concentrations of EMTRICITABINE.TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE
> Tenof ovir alafenamide is transported by P -glycoprotein (P -gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Medicinal products that strongly affect P -gp activity and BCRP may lead to changes in TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE absorption. Medicinal products that induce P -gp activity ( e.g., rifampicin, RIFABUTIN, CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENOBARBITAL) are expected to decrease the absorption of TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE, resulting in decreased plasma concentration of TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE, which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE and development of resistance. Co -administration oftenofovir alafenamide with other medicinal products that inhibit P -gp (e.g., COBICISTAT, RITONAVIR, CICLOSPORIN) are expected to increase the absorption and plasma concentration of te nofovir alafenamide. It is not known whether the co -administration of TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE and xa nthine oxidase inhibitors (e.g. FEBUXOSTAT) would increase systemic exposure to TENOFOVIR.TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C 8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 in vitro . It is not an inhibitor of CYP3A4 in vivo . TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE is a substrate of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in vitro . The distribution of TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE in the body may be affected by the activity of OATP1B1 and OAT P1B3.Interaction table
> Expected i nteractions between SYMTUZA with potential concomitant medici nal products are listed in Table 1below and are based on the studies conducted with the components of SYMTUZA , as individual agents or combined, or are potenti al interactions that may occur.Interaction trials with the components of SYMTUZA have only been performed in adults.The interaction profile of DARUNAVIR depends on whether RITONAVIR or COBICISTAT is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer ; therefore ,there may be different recommendations for the use of DARUNAVIR with concomitant medicine s.Refer to the prescribing information for DARUNAVIR for further information.The below list of examples of interactions is not comprehensive and therefore the label of ea ch medicinal product that is co -administered with SYMTUZA should be consulted for information related to the route of metabolism, interaction pathways, potential risks, and specific actions to be taken with regards to co -administration.Table 1: Interacti ons between the individual components of SYMTUZA and other medicinal products

Co-administration of DOMPERIDONE with SYMTUZA is contraindica ted.ANTIFUNGALSClotrimazole
> Based on theoretical considerations DRV/COBI is expected to increase these antifungal plasma concentrations, and DARUNAVIR, COBICISTAT and/or TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE plasma concentrations may be increased by the antifungals.(CYP3A and/or P -gp inhibition)Concentrations of VORICONAZOLE may increase or decrease when co-administered with DRV/COBI.Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring is recommended.When co -administration is required, the daily dose of ITRACONAZOLE should not exceed 
200mg.VORICONAZOLE should not be combined with SYMTUZA unless an assessment of the benefit/risk ratio justifies the use of VORICONAZOLE.ANTIGOUT MEDICINESColchicin e Based on theoretical considerations DRV/COBI is expected to increase COLCHICINE plasma concentrations.(CYP3A and/or P -glycoprotein inhibition)A reduction in COLCHICINE dose or an interruption of COLCHICINE treatment is recommended in patients with norm al renal or hepatic function if treatment with SYMTUZA is required.The combination of COLCHICINE and SYMTUZA is contraindicated in patients with renal or hepatic impairm ent (see section 4.3).12ANTIMALARIALSArtemether/LUMEFANTRINE Based on theoretical co nsiderations DRV/COBI is expected to increase LUMEFANTRINE plasma concentrations.(CYP3A inhibition)SYMTUZA and ARTEMETHER/LUMEFANTRINE can be used without dose adjustments; however, due to the increase in LUMEFANTRINE exposure, the combination should be used with caution.ANTIMYCOBACTERIALSRifampicin Based on theoretical considerations rifampicin is expected to decrease DARUNAVIR and/or COBICISTAT and/or TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE plasma concentrations.(CYP3A and/or P -gp induction)The combination of rifam picin and SYMTUZA is contraindicated (see section 4.3).RIFABUTIN
> Based on theoretical considerations these ANTIMYCOBACTERIALS are expected to decrease DARUNAVIR and/or COBICISTAT and/or TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE plasma concentrations.(CYP3A and/ or P-gp induction)Co-administration of SYMTUZA with RIFABUTIN and RIFAPENTINE is not recommended. If the combination is needed, the recommended dose of RIFABUTIN is 
150mg 3 times per w eek on set days (for example Monday -Wednesday -Friday). Increased monit oring for RIFABUTIN associated adverse reactions including neutropenia and uveitis is warranted due to an expected increase in exposure to RIFABUTIN. Further dose reduction of RIFABUTIN has not been studied. It should be kept in mind that the twice weekly dose of 150 mg may not provide an optimal exposure to RIFABUTIN thus leading to a risk of rifamycin resistance and a treatment failure. Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate treatment of tuberculosis in HIV infected patients .This recommendation is different from RITONAVIR -boosted DARUNAVIR. Consult the Summary of Product Characteristics for DARUNAVIR for further details.ANTI -NEOPLASTICSDasatinib
> Based on th eoretical considerations DRV/COBI is expected to increase these anti -neoplastic plasma concentrations.(CYP3A inhibition)Concentrations of these medicinal products may be increased when co-administered with SYMTUZA resulting in the potential for increased adverse events usually associated with these medicinal products.Caution should be exercised when combining one of these anti-neoplastic agents with SYMTUZA.Concomitant use of EVEROLIMUS or IRINOTECAN and SYMTUZA is not recommended.13ANTIPSYCHOTICS/NEUR OLEPTICSPerphenazine
