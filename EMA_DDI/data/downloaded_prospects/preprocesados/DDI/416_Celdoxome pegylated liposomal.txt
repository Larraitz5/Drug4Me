> No formal medicinal product interaction studies have been performed with liposomal DOXORUBICIN, although phase  II combination trials with conventional chemotherapy agents have been conducted in patients with gynaecological malignancie s. Caution in the concomitant use of medicinal products known to interact with standard DOXORUBICIN HYDROCHLORIDE  must be e xercised . CELDOXOME PEGYLATED LIPOSOMAL , like other DOXORUBICIN HYDROCHLORIDE preparations, may potentiate the toxicity of other anti -cancer therapies. During clinical trials in patients with solid tumours (including breast and ovarian cancer) who have received concomitant CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE or TAXANES, no new additive toxicities were noted. In patients with AIDS, exacerbation of CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE -induced haemorrhagic cystitis and enhancement of the hepatotoxicity of 6- MERCAPTOPURINE have been reported with standard DOXORUBICIN HYDROCHLORIDE. Caution must be exercised when giving any other cytotoxic agents, especially myelotoxic agents, at the same time.
