> Co-administration of multiple doses of SITAGLIPTIN (50  mg twice daily) and METFORMIN (1,000  mg twice daily) did not meaningfull y alter the pharmacokinetics of either SITAGLIPTIN or METFORMIN in patients with type 2 diabetes. 
> Some medicinal products can adversely affect renal function, which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, e.g. NSAIDs, including selective cyclo -oxygenase (COX)  II inhibitors, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and DIURETICS, especially LOOP DIURETICS. When starting or using such medicinal products in combination with METFORMIN, close monitoring of renal function is necessary. 
> Concomitant use of medicinal products  that interfere with common renal tubular transport systems involved in the renal elimination of METFORMIN (e.g., organic cationic transporter -2 [OCT2]  / multidrug and toxin extrusion [MATE] inhibitors such as ranolazin e, VANDETANIB, DOLUTEGRAVIR, and CIMETIDINE) could increase systemic exposure to METFORMIN and may increase the risk for lactic acidosis. Consider the benefits and risks of concomitant use. Close monitoring of glycaemic control, dose adjustment within the recommended posology and changes in diabetic treatment should be considered when such medicinal products are co -administered. 
> ACE -inhibitors may decrease the blood GLUCOSE levels. If necessary, the dose of the anti-hyperglycaemic medicinal product should be adjusted during therapy with the other medicinal product and on i ts discontinuation. 
> In vitro transport studies showed that SITAGLIPTIN is a substrate for p -glycoprotein and organic anion transporter -3 (OAT3). OAT3 mediated transport of SITAGLIPTIN was inhibited in vitro by PROBENECID, although the risk of clinically meaningful interaction s is considered to be low. Concomitant administration of OAT3 inhibitors has not been evaluated in vivo .
> CICLOSPORIN: A study was conducted to assess the effect of CICLOSPORIN, a potent inhibitor of p-glycoprotein, on the pharmacokinetics of SITAGLIPTIN. Co-administration of a single 100  mg oral dose of SITAGLIPTIN and a single 600  mg oral dose of CICLOSPORIN increased the AUC and C max of SITAGLIPTIN by approximately 29  % and 68  %, respectively. These changes in SITAGLIPTIN pharmacokinetics were not consid ered to be clinically meaningful. The renal clearance of SITAGLIPTIN was not meaningfully altered. Therefore, meaningful interactions would not be expected with other p -glycoprotein inhibitors. 
> DIGOXIN : SITAGLIPTIN had a small effect on plasma DIGOXIN concentrations. Following administration of 
0.25 mg DIGOXIN concomitantly with 100  mg of SITAGLIPTIN daily for 10  days, the plasma AUC of DIGOXIN was increased on average by 11  %, and the plasma C max on aver age by 18  %. No dose adjustment of DIGOXIN is recommended. However, patients at risk of DIGOXIN toxicity should be monitored for this when SITAGLIPTIN and DIGOXIN are administered concomitantly.
