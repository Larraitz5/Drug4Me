> Concomitant treatment with methylxanthine derivatives, stero ids, or non -POTASSIUM -sparing DIURETICS  may potentiate the possible hypokalaemic effect of Î²2-adrenergic agonists, therefore caution is advised in their concomitant use (see section  4.4).
> Brimi ca Genuair should be administered with caution to patients being treated with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors,  tricyclic ANTIDEPRESSANTS , antihistamines  or MACROLIDES because the action of FORMOTEROL, a component of Brimica  Genuair , on the CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM may be potentiated by these medicinal products . Medicinal products  that are known to prolong the QTc interval are associated with an  increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias.
