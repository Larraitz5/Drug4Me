> Other antihypertensive agents:  the antihypertensive effect of KARVEZIDE may be increased with the concomitant use of other antihypertensi ve agents. IRBESARTAN and HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE (at doses up to 
300 mg IRBESARTAN/25  mg HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE) have been safely administered with other antihypertensive agents including CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS and beta -adrenergic blockers. Prior treatment wit h high dose DIURETICS may result in volume depletion and a risk of hypotension when initiating therapy with IRBESARTAN with or without thiazide DIURETICS unless the volume depletion is corrected first (see section  4.4).
> ALISKIREN -containing products  or AC E-inhibitors : clinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of the renin -angiotensin -aldosterone system (RAAS) through the combined use of ACE -inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or ALISKIREN is associated with a higher frequency of adverse eve nts such as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to the use of a single RAAS -acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). 
> LITHIUM:  reversible increases in serum LITHIUM concentrations and toxici ty have been reported during concomitant administration of LITHIUM with angiotensin converting ENZYME INHIBITORS. Similar effects have been very rarely reported with IRBESARTAN so far. Furthermore, renal clearance of LITHIUM is reduced by thiazides so the risk of LITHIUM toxicity could be increased with KARVEZIDE. Therefore, the combination of LITHIUM and KARVEZIDE is not recommended (see section  4.4). If the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum LITHIUM levels is recommended. 
> Medicinal  products affecting POTASSIUM:  the POTASSIUM -depleting effect of HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE is attenuated by the POTASSIUM -sparing effect of IRBESARTAN. However, this effect of HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE on serum POTASSIUM would be expected to be potentiated by other me dicinal products associated with POTASSIUM loss and hypokalaemia (e.g.  other kaliuretic DIURETICS, LAXATIVES, amphotericin,  7 carbenoxolone, penicillin  G sodium). Conversely, based on the experience with the use of other medicinal products that blunt the ren in-angiotensin system, concomitant use of POTASSIUM -sparing DIURETICS, POTASSIUM supplements, salt substitutes containing POTASSIUM or other medicinal products that may increase serum POTASSIUM levels (e.g.  HEPARIN sodium) may lead to increases in serum POTASSIUM. Adequate monitoring of serum POTASSIUM in patients at risk is recommended (see section  4.4).
> As with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin  II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an increased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and an increase in serum POTASSIUM, especially in patients with poor pre -existing renal function. The combination should be administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patien ts should be adequately hydrated and consideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and periodically thereafter. 
> REPAGLINIDE:  IRBESARTAN has the potential to inhibit OATP1B1. In a clinical study, it was  reported that IRBESARTAN increased the C max and AUC of REPAGLINIDE (substrate of OATP1B1) by 1.8 -fold and 
1.3-fold, respectively, when administered 1 hour before REPAGLINIDE. In another study, no relevant pharmacokinetic interaction was reported, when the  two drugs were co -administered. Therefore, dose adjustment of antidiabetic treatment such as REPAGLINIDE may be required  (see section 4.4). 
> CORTICOSTEROIDS, ACTH:  electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalaemia, may be increased; 
> Antigout medicinal products:  dosage adjustments of antigout medicinal products may be necessary as HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE may raise the level of serum uric acid. Increase in dosage of PROBENECID or SULFINPYRAZONE may be necessary. C o-administration of thiazide DIURETICS may increase the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions to ALLOPURINOL; 
> CALCIUM salts:  thiazide DIURETICS may increase serum CALCIUM levels due to decreased excretion. If CALCIUM supplements or CALCIUM sparing medic inal products (e.g. vitamin D therapy) must be prescribed, serum CALCIUM levels should be monitored and CALCIUM dosage adjusted accordingly; 
> CARBAMAZEPINE: concomitant use of CARBAMAZEPINE and HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE has been associated with the risk of sympt omatic hyponatraemia. ELECTROLYTES should be monitored during concomitant use. If possible, another class of DIURETICS should be used; 
> Other interactions:  the hyperglycaemic effect of beta -blockers and DIAZOXIDE may be enhanced by thiazides. Anticholinerg ic agents (e.g.  ATROPINE, BIPERIDEN ) may increase the bioavailability of thiazide -type DIURETICS by decreasing gastrointestinal motility and stomach emptying rate. Thiazides may increase the risk of adverse effects caused by AMANTADINE. Thiazides may reduc e the renal excretion of cytotoxic medicinal products (e.g.  CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE, METHOTREXATE) and potentiate their myelosuppressive effects.
