> Based on in vitro  studies, no clinically relevant interactions between NALMEFENE, or its metabolites, and concomitantly administered medicinal products metabolised by the most common CYP450 and UGT ENZYMES or membrane transporters are anticipated. Co -administration with medicinal products that are potent inhibitors of the UGT2B7 enzyme (for example, DICLOFENAC , FLUCONAZOLE, MEDROXYPROGESTERONE acetate, MECLOFENAMIC ACID) may significantly increase the exposure to NALMEFENE. This is unlikely to present a problem with occasional use, but if long-term concurrent treatment with a potent UGT2B7 inhibitor is initiate d, a potential for an increase in NALMEFENE exposure cannot be excluded (see section  4.4).  Conversely, concomitant administration with a UGT inducer (for example, DEXAMETHASONE, PHENOBARBITAL, rifampicin, OMEPRAZOLE) may potentially lead to subtherapeutic NALMEFENE plasma concentrations. 
> There is no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic drug -drug interaction between NALMEFENE and alcohol.  There seems to be a small impairment in cognitive and psychomotor performance after administration of NALMEFENE. However, the effect  of NALMEFENE and alcohol in combination did not exceed the sum of the effects of each substance when taken alone.
