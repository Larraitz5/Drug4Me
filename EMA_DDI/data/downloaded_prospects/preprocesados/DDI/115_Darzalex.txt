> G1 Ò› monoclonal antibody, renal excretion and hepatic enzyme -mediated metabolism of intact daratumumab are unlikely to represent major elimination routes. As such, variations in drug-metabolising ENZYMES are not expected to affect the elimination of daratumumab. Due to the high affinity to a unique epitope on CD38, daratumumab is not anticipated to alter drug -metabolising ENZYMES.Clinical pharmacokinetic assessments of daratumumab in combination with LENALIDOMIDE, POMALIDOMIDE, THALIDOMIDE, bortezo mib and DEXAMETHASONE indicated no clinically -relevant drug -drug interaction between daratumumab and these small molecule medicinal products.Interference with indirect antiglobulin test (indirect Coombs test)Daratumumab binds to CD38 on RBCs and interf eres with compatibility testing, including antibody screening and cross matching (see section 4.4). Daratumumab interference mitigation methods include treating reagent RBCs with dithiothreitol (DTT) to disrupt daratumumab binding or other locally 9validate d methods. Since the Kell blood group system is also sensitive to DTT treatment, Kell-negative units should be supplied after ruling out or identifying alloantibodies using DTT -treated RBCs. Alternatively, phenotyping or genotyping may also be considered ( see section 4.4).Interference with serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation tests
