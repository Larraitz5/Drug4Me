> DOLUTEGRAVIR is eliminated mainly through metabolism by URIDINE diphosphate glucurono syl transferase (UGT) 1A1. DOLUTEGRAVIR is also a substrate of UGT1A3, UGT1A9, CYP3A4, P -glycoprotein ( P-gp), and breast cancer resistance protein  (BCRP ). Co-administratio n of TRIUMEQ and other medicinal products  that inhibit UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, CYP3A4, and/or P -gp may therefore increase DOLUTEGRAVIR plasma concentration. Medicinal products  that induce those ENZYMES or 8 transporters may decrease DOLUTEGRAVIR plasma concentration and reduce the therapeutic effect of DOLUTEGRAVIR (see Table 1). 
> ABACAVIR is metabolised by UGT (UGT2B7) and alcohol dehydrogenase; co-administration of inducers  (e.g. rifampicin, CARBAMAZEPINE and PHENYTOIN)  or inhibitors (e.g. VALPROIC ACID) of UGT ENZYMES or with compounds eliminated through alcohol dehydrogenase could alter ABACAVIR exposure. 
> LAMIVUDINE is cleared renally. Active  renal secretion of LAMIVUDINE in the urine is mediated through the OCT 2 and multidrug and toxin extrusion transporters (MATE1 and MATE2- K). TRIMETHOPRIM (an inhibitor of these drug transporters) has been shown to increase LAMIVUDINE plasma concentrations , however the resulting increase was not  clinical ly significan t (see Table 1) . DOLUTEGRAVIR is an OCT2 and MATE1 inhibitor; however, LAMIVUDINE concentrations were similar with or without co-administration of DOLUTEGRAVIR based on a cross study analysis, indicating that DOLUTEGRAVIR has no effect on LAMIVUDINE exposure in vivo . LAMIVUDINE is also substrate of the hepatic uptake transporter  OCT1. As hepatic elimination plays a mi nor role in the clearance of LAMIVUDINE, drug interactions due to inhibition of OCT1 are unlikely to be of clinical significance .
> In vitro , DOLUTEGRAVIR inhibited the renal transporters OCT2 and MATE1 . In viv o, a 10- 14% decrease of creatinine clearance (secretory fraction is dependent on OCT2 and MATE1 transport) was observed in patients. In vivo , DOLUTEGRAVIR may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products in which excretion is dependent upon OCT2 an d/or MATE1 (e.g. FAMPRIDINE  [also known as dalfampridine] , METFORMIN) (see Table 1).   In vitro , DOLUTEGRAVIR inhibited the renal uptake organic anion transporters (OAT)1 and OAT3. Based on the lack of effect on the  in vivo  pharmacokinetics of the OAT subs trate TENOFOVIR, in vivo  inhibition of OAT1 is unlikely. Inhibition of OAT3 has not been studied in vivo . DOLUTEGRAVIR may increase plasma concentrations of medic inal products in which excretion is dependent upon OAT3.  
> Interactions between DOLUTEGRAVIR, ABACAVIR , LAMIVUDINE and co-administered medical products are listed in Table 1 ( increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”, area under the concentration versus time curve as “AUC”, maximum observed concentration as “C max”, concentration 9 at end of dosing inter val as “Cτ ”). The table  should not be considered exhaustive but is representative of the classes studied.
