 Coadministration of voriconazole and EVEROLIMUS is not recommended because voriconazole is expected to significantly increase everoli mus concentrations (see s ection 4.4). 
> When initiati ng voriconazole in patients already on CICLOSPORIN it is recommended that the CICLOSPORIN dose be halved and CICLOSPORIN level carefully monitored. Increased CICLOSPORIN levels have been associated with nephrot oxicity. When voriconazole is discontinued, CICLOSPORIN levels must be carefully monitored and the dose increased as necessary .

Extended and frequent monitoring for respiratory depression and  other opiate -associated adverse reactions is recommended.  Statins (e.g., LOVASTATIN)  
[CYP3A4 substrates]  Although not studied , voriconazole is likely to increase the plasma concentrations of statins that are metabolised by CYP3A4 and could l ead to rhabd omyolysis.  If concomitant administration of voriconaz ole with statins metabolised by CYP3A4 cann ot be avoided, dose reduction of  the statin  should be considered.

[CYP3A4 substrates and inhibitors]  Not studi ed clinically. In vitro  studies show that voriconazole may inhibit the metabolism of HIV PROTEASE INHIBITORS and the metabolism of voriconazole m ay also be inhibited by HIV PROTEASE INHIBITORS.

In vitro  studies show that t he metabolism of voriconazole may be inhibited by NNRTIs and voriconazole may inhibit the metabolism of NNRTIs.  The findings of the effect of EFAVIRENZ on voriconaz ole suggest that the metabolism of voriconazole may be induced by a NNRTI.
