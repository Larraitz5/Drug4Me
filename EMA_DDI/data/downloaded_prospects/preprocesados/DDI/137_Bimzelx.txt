> No interaction studies have been performed. There is no direct evidence for the role of IL -17A or IL -17F in the expression of CYP450 ENZYMES. The formation of some CYP450 ENZYMES is suppressed by increased levels of cytokines during chronic inflammation. Thus, anti-inflammatory treatments, such as with the IL -17A and IL -17F inhibitor bimekizumab, may result in normalisation of CYP450 levels with accompanying lower exposure of CYP450-metabolised medicinal products. Therefore, a clinically relevant effect on CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, in which the dose is individually adjusted (e. g. WARFARIN) cannot be excluded. On initiation of bimekizumab therapy in patients being treated with these types of medicinal products, therapeutic monitoring should be considered.
