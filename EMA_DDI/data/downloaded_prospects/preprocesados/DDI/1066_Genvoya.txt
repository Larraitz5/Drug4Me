> ELVITEGRAVIR is primarily metabolised by CYP3A, and medicinal products that induce or inhibit CYP3A may affect the exposure of ELVITEGRAVIR.   Co-administration of GENVOYA with medicinal products that induce CYP3A may result in decreased plasma concentrations of ELVITEGRAVIR and reduced therapeutic effect of GENVOYA (see “Concomitant use contraindicated” and section  4.3).  ELVITEGRAVIR may have the potential to induce CYP2C9 and/or inducible URIDINE diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase ( UGT ) ENZYMES; as such it may decrease the plasma concentration of substrates of these ENZYMES .
> COBICISTAT is a strong mechanism -based inhibitor of CYP3A and is also a CYP3A substrate.   COBICISTAT is also a weak CYP2D6 inhibitor and is metabolised, to a minor extent, by CYP2D6.   Medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A may decrease the clearance of COBICISTAT, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of COBICISTAT.   Medicinal products t hat have active metabolite(s) formed by CYP3A may result in reduced plasma concentrations of these active metabolite(s). 
> Medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP3A metabolism and have high first pass metabolism are the most susceptible to large increases in exposure when co -administered with COBICISTAT (see “Concomitant use contraindicated” and section  4.3).
> COBICISTAT is an inhibitor of the following transporters: P-gp, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporting polype ptide (OATP)  1B1 and OATP1B3.   Co-administration with medicinal products that are substrates of P -gp, BCRP, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 may result in increased plasma concentrations of these products. 
> In vitro  and clinical pharmacokinetic drug-drug  interaction studies have shown that the potential for CYP -mediated interactions involving EMTRICITABINE with other medicinal products is low.  Co-administration of EMTRICITABINE with medicinal products that are eliminated by active tubular secretion may i ncrease concentrations of EMTRICITABINE, and/or the co -administered medicinal product.   Medicinal products that decrease renal function may increase concentrations of EMTRICITABINE. 
> TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE is transported by P -gp and BCRP .  Medicinal products that strongly affect P -gp and BCRP activity may lead to changes in TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE absorption.   However, upon co-administration with COBICISTAT in GENVOYA, near maximal inhibition of P -gp by COBICISTAT is achieved leadi ng to increased availability of TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE with resulting exposures comparable to TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE 25  mg administered alone.   As such, TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE exposures following administration of GENVOYA are not expected to be further increased when used in combination with another P -gp and/or BCRP inhibitor (e.g., KETOCONAZOLE ).  Based on data from an in vitro  study, co -administration of TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE and xanthine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., FEBUXOSTAT) is not expected to increase syst emic exposure to TENOFOVIR in  vivo.   In vitro  and clinical pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies have shown that the potential for CYP -mediated interactions involving TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE with other medicinal products is low.   TENOFOVIR alafenamid e is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6.   TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE is not an inhibitor or inducer of CYP3A in  vivo.   TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE is a substrate of OATP in  vitro .  Inhibitors of OATP and BCRP include c iclosporin. 
> Co-administration of GENVOYA  and some medicinal products that are primar ily metaboli sed by CYP3A may result in increased plasma concentrations of these products, which are associated with the potential for serious or life -threatening adverse reactions such as peripheral vasospasm or isch aemia (e.g., DIHYDROERGOTAMINE, ERGOTAMINE, ergometrine ), or myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis (e. g., SIMVASTATIN, LOVASTATIN), or prolonged or increased sedation or respiratory depression (e. g., orally administered MIDAZOLAM or TRIAZOLAM).  Co-administration of GENVOYA  and other medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP3A such as AMIODARONE, LOMITAPIDE, QUINIDINE, CISAPRIDE, PIMOZIDE,  LURASIDONE,  alfuzo sin and SILDENAFIL  for pulmonary  arterial hypertension  is contraindicated (see section  4.3).
> Co-administration of GENVOYA  and some medicinal products that induce CYP3A  such as St. John’s wort ( Hypericum perforatum), rifampi cin, CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENOBARBITAL , and PHENYTOIN  may result in significantly decreased  COBICISTAT and ELVITEGRAVIR plasma concentrations, which may result in loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance (see section  4.3).
> Interact ions between the components of GENVOYA and potential co-administered medicinal products are listed in Table  1 below (increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”).  The interactions described are based on studies conducted with GENVOYA , or the components of GENVOYA  (ELVITEGRAVIR, COBICISTAT, EMTRICITABINE, and TENOFOVIR ala fenamide), as individual agents and/or in combination, or are potential drug-drug interactions  that may occur with GENVOYA .

> If the combination is needed, the recommended dose of RIFABUTIN is 150 mg 3  times per week on set days (for example Monday -Wednesday -Friday). Increased monitoring for RIFABUTIN -associated adverse reactions including neutropenia and uveitis is warranted due to an expected increase in exposure to desacetyl -RIFABUTIN.  Further dose reduction of r ifabutin has not been studied.  It should be kept in mind that a twice weekly dose of 150  mg may not provide an optimal exposure to RIFABUTIN thus leading to a risk of rifamy cin resistance and a treatment failure.  10 Medicinal product by therapeutic areas  Effects on medicinal product  levels .

Mean percent change in AUC, Cmax, C min1 Recommendation concerning co-administration with GENVOYA GLUCOCORTICOIDS  CORTICOSTEROIDS  CORTICOSTEROIDS primarily metabolised by CYP3A (including BETAMETHASONE, BUDESONIDE, FLUTICASONE, MOMETASONE, PREDNISONE, TRIAMCINOLONE).  Interaction not studied with any of the components of GENVOYA .
> Plasma concentrations of these medicinal products may be increased when co- administered with GENVOYA, resulting in reduced serum cortisol concentrations.  Concomitant use of Gen voya and CORTICOSTEROIDS that are metabolised by CYP3A (e.g. FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE or other inhaled or nasal CORTICOSTEROIDS) may increase the risk of development of systemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression. 
> Co-administration with CYP3A- metabolised CORTICOSTEROIDS is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk, in which case patients should be monitored for systemic corticosteroid effects.  Alternative CORTICOSTEROIDS which are less dependent on CYP3A metabolism e.g. BECLOMETHASONE for intranasal or inhalational use should be considered, particularly for long-term use.
