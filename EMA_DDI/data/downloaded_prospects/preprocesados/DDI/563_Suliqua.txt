> Substances that may enhance the blood -GLUCOSE-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to hypoglycaemia include anti- hyperglycaemic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, DISOPYRAMIDE, FIBRATES, FLUOXETINE, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, PENTOXIFYLLINE, PROPOXYPHENE, salicylates and sul phonamide ANTIBIOTICS. 
> Substances that may reduce the blood-GLUCOSE- lowering effect include CORTICOSTEROIDS, DANAZOL, DIAZOXIDE, DIURETICS, GLUCAGON, ISONIAZID, oestrogens and PROGESTOGENS, PHENOTHIAZINE DERIVATIVES, SOMATROPIN, sympathomimet ic medicinal products  (e.g. , EPINEPHRINE [adrenaline], SALBUTAMOL, TERBUTALINE), THYROID HORMONES, atypical antipsychotic medicinal products (e.g., CLOZAPINE and OLANZAPINE) and PROTEASE INHIBITORS.
> Beta-blockers, CLONIDINE, LITHIUM salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-GLUCOSE- lowering effect of insulin. PENTAMIDINE may cause hypoglycaemia, which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.  In addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta -blockers, CLONIDINE, GUANETHIDINE and RESERPINE, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent.
> Paracetamol  Paracetamol was used as a model medicinal product to evaluate the effect of LIXISENATIDE on gastric emptying. Following administration of a single dose of paracetamol 1000 mg, paracetamol AUC and t
1/2 were unchanged whatever the timing of its administration (before or after the LIXISENATIDE injection). When administered 1 or 4  hours after 10 mcg LIXISENATIDE, C max of paracetamol was decreased by 29% and 31%, respectively and median t max was delayed by 2.0 and 1.75 hours, respectively. A further delay in t max and a reduced C max of paracetamol have been predicted with the 
20 mcg maintenance dose.  8 No effects on paracetamol C max and t max were observed when paracetamol was administered 1  hour before LIXISENATIDE. 
> Administration of the oral contraceptive 1  hour before or 4 hours after LIXISENATIDE did not affect AUC and t
1/2 of ethinylestradiol and LEVONORGESTREL, whereas C max of ethinylestradiol was decreased by 52% and 39%, respecti vely and C max of LEVONORGESTREL was decreased by 46% and 20%, respectively and median t max was delayed by 1 to 3 hours. The reduction in C max is of limited clinical relevance and no dose adjustment for oral contraceptives is required.  ATORVASTATIN  When li xisenatide 20 mcg and ATORVASTATIN 40 mg were co -administered in the morning for 6 days, the exposure to ATORVASTATIN was not affected, while C max was decreased by 31% and t max was delayed by 
3.25 hours.  No such increase for tmax was observed when atorvas tatin was administered in the evening and LIXISENATIDE in the morning but the AUC and C max of ATORVASTATIN were increased by 27% and 66%, respectively. 
> WARFARIN and other COUMARIN derivatives After concomitant administration of WARFARIN 25 mg with repeated dosing of LIXISENATIDE 20 mcg, there were no effec ts on AUC or INR (International Normalised Ratio) while Cmax was reduced by 19% and tmax was delayed by 7 hours. Based on these results, no dose adjustment for WARFARIN is required when co -administered with LIXISENATIDE; however, frequent monitoring of INR in patients on WARFARIN and/or COUMARIN derivatives is recommended at the time of initiation or ending of LIXISENATIDE treatment. 
> DIGOXIN After concomitant administration of LIXISENATIDE 20 mcg and DIGOXIN 0.25 mg at steady state, the AUC of DIGOXIN was not affected. The t max of DIGOXIN was delayed by 1.5 hour and the C max was reduced by  
26%. Based on these results, no dose adjustment for DIGOXIN is required when co-administered with LIXISENATIDE. 
> RAMIPRIL After concomitant administration of LIXISENATIDE 20 mcg and RAMIPRIL 5 mg during 6 days, the AUC of RAMIPRIL was increased by 21% while the C max was decreased by 63%. The AUC and C max of the active metabolite (ramiprilat) were not affected. The t max of RAMIPRIL and ramiprilat were delayed by approximately 2.5 hours. Based on these results, no dose adjustment for RAMIPRIL is required when co -administered with LIXISENATIDE.
