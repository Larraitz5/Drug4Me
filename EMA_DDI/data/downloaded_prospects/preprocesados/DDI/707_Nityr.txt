> Based on data from a clinical interaction study with 80 mg nitisinone at steady- state, nitisinone is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C9 (2.3-fold increase in TOLBUTAMIDE AUC), therefore nitisinone treatment may result in increased plasma concentrations of co- administered medicinal products metabolized primarily via CYP2C9 (see section 4.4). 5 Nitisinone is a weak inducer of CYP2E1 (30 % decrease in CHLORZOXAZONE AUC) and a weak inhibitor of OAT1 and OAT3 (1.7- fold increase in AUC of furosemi de), whereas nitisinone did not inhibit CYP2D6 (see section 5.2).
