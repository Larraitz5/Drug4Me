> Tadalafil is principally metabolised by CYP3A4. A selective inhibitor of CYP3A4, KETOCONAZOLE (200 mg daily), increased tadalafil (10 mg) exposure (AUC) 2-fold and C max by 15%, relative to the AUC and C max values for tadalafil alone. KETOCONAZOLE (400 mg daily) increased tadalafil (20 mg) exposure (AUC) 4-fold and C max by 22%. RITONAVIR, a protease inhibitor (200 mg twice daily), which is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, increased tadalafil (20 mg) exposure (AUC) 2-fold with no change in Cmax. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other PROTEASE INHIBITORS, such as SAQUINAVIR, and other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ERYTHROMYCIN, CLARITHROMYCIN, ITRACONAZOLE and GRAPEFRUIT JUICE should be co-administered with caution as they would be expected to increase plasma concentrations of tadalafil (see section 4.4).Consequently the incidence of the adverse reactions listed in section 4.8 might be increased.6Transporters
> A CYP3A4 inducer, rifampicin, reduced tadalafil AUC by 88%, relative to the AUC values for tadalafil alone (10 mg). This reduced exposure can be anticipated to decrease the efficacy of tadalafil; the magnitude of decreased efficacy is unknown. Other inducers of CYP3A4 such as PHENOBARBITAL, PHENYTOIN and CARBAMAZEPINE, may also decrease plasma concentrations of tadalafil.Effects of tadalafil on other medicinal products
> In clinical studies, tadalafil (5, 10 and 20 mg) was shown to augment the hypotensive effects of nitrates. Therefore, administration of tadalafil to patients who are using any form of organic nitrate is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Based on the results of a clinical study in which 150 subjects receiving daily doses of tadalafil 20 mg for 7 days and 0.4 mg sublingual NITROGLYCERIN at VARIOUS times, this interaction lasted for more than 24 hours and was no longer detectable when 48 hours had elapsed after the last tadalafil dose. Thus, in a patient prescribed any dose of tadalafil (2.5 mg-20 mg), where nitrate administration is deemed medically necessary in a life-threatening situation, at least 48 hours should have elapsed after the last dose of tadalafil before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should only be administered under close medical supervision with appropriate haemodynamic monitoring.Anti-hypertensives (including CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS)The co-administration of DOXAZOSIN (4 and 8 mg daily) and tadalafil (5 mg daily dose and 20 mg as a single dose) increases the blood pressure-lowering effect of this alpha-blocker in a significant manner. This effect lasts at least twelve hours and may be symptomatic, including syncope. Therefore this combination is not recommended (see section 4.4).In interaction studies performed in a limited number of healthy volunteers, these effects were not reported with ALFUZOSIN or TAMSULOSIN. However, caution should be exercised when using tadalafil in patients treated with any alpha-blockers, and notably in the elderly. Treatments should be initiated at minimal dosage and progressively adjusted.In clinical pharmacology studies, the potential for tadalafil to augment the hypotensive effects of antihypertensive medicinal products was examined. Major classes of antihypertensive medicinal products were studied, including CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS (AMLODIPINE), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ENALAPRIL), beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (METOPROLOL), thiazide DIURETICS (BENDROFLUMETHIAZIDE), and angiotensin II receptor blockers (VARIOUS types and doses, alone or in combination with thiazides, CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS, beta-blockers, and/or alpha-blockers). Tadalafil (10 mg except for studies with angiotensin II receptor blockers and AMLODIPINE in which a 20 mg dose was applied) had no clinically significant interaction with any of these classes. In another clinical pharmacology study tadalafil (20 mg) was studied in combination with up to 4 classes of ANTIHYPERTENSIVES. In subjects taking multiple ANTIHYPERTENSIVES, the ambulatory-blood-pressure changes appeared to relate to the degree of blood-pressure control. In this regard, study subjects whose blood pressure was well controlled, the reduction was minimal and similar to that seen in healthy subjects. In study subjects whose blood pressure was not controlled, the reduction was greater although this reduction was not associated with hypotensive symptoms in the majority of subjects. In patients receiving concomitant antihypertensive medicinal products, tadalafil 
20 mg may induce a blood pressure decrease, which (with the exception of alpha blockers -see above-) is, in general, minor and not likely to be clinically relevant. Analysis of phase 3 clinical trial data showed no difference in adverse events in patients taking tadalafil with or without antihypertensive medicinal products. However, appropriate clinical advice should be given to patients regarding a possible decrease in blood pressure when they are treated with antihypertensive medicinal products.RIOCIGUAT
> Preclinical studies showed an additive systemic blood pressure lowering effect when PDE5 inhibitors were combined with RIOCIGUAT. In clinical studies, RIOCIGUAT has been shown to augment the hypotensive effects of PDE5 inhibitors. There was no evidence of favourable clinical effect of the combination in the population 7studied. Concomitant use of RIOCIGUAT with PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, is contraindicated (see section 4.3).  
5-alpha reductase inhibitors
> In a clinical trial that compared tadalafil 5 mg coadministered with FINASTERIDE 5 mg to placebo plus FINASTERIDE 5 mg in the relief of BPH symptoms, no new adverse reactions were identified. However, as a formal drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effects of tadalafil and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) has not been performed, caution should be exercised when tadalafil is co-administered with 
5-ARIs.CYP1A2 substrates (e.g. THEOPHYLLINE)When tadalafil 10 mg was administered with THEOPHYLLINE (a non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor) in a clinical pharmacology study, there was no pharmacokinetic interaction. The only pharmacodynamic effect was a small (3.5 bpm) increase in heart rate. Although this effect is minor and was of no clinical significance in this study, it should be considered when co-administering these medicinal products.Ethinylestradiol and TERBUTALINE
> Tadalafil has been demonstrated to produce an increase in the oral bioavailability of ethinylestradiol; a similar increase may be expected with oral administration of TERBUTALINE, although the clinical consequence of this is uncertain.Alcohol
> Tadalafil (10 mg and 20 mg) did not potentiate the increase in bleeding time caused by acetyl SALICYLIC ACID.Antidiabetic medicinal products
