> Since androgen deprivation treatment may prolong the QTc interval, the concomitant use of DEGARELIX with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval or medicinal products able to induce torsades de pointes  such as class IA (e.g. QUINIDINE, DISOPYRAMIDE) or class III (e.g. AMIODARONE, SOTALOL, DOFETILIDE, IBUTILIDE) antiarrhythmic medicinal products, METHADONE, MOXIFLOXACIN, ANTIPSYCHOTICS, etc. should be carefully evaluated (see section 4.4).
