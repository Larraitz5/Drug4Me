> A decrease in CICLOSPORIN plasma levels has been observed in a drug -drug interaction study and  also reported in several cases, when orlistat was administered concomitantly. This could potentially lead to a decrease of immunosuppressive efficacy. Concurrent use of alli and CICLOSPORIN is contraindicated (see section  4.3).
> When WARFARIN or other oral anticoagulants are given in combination with orlistat, international normalised ratio (INR) values could be affected (see section  4.8). Concurrent use of alli and WARFARIN or other oral anticoagulants is contraindicated (see section  4.3).
> Hypothyroidism and/or reduced control of hypothyroidism may occur w hen orlistat and LEVOTHYROXINE are taken at the same time (see section  4.4). This could be due to a decreased absorption of IODINE salts and/or LEVOTHYROXINE. 
> Convulsions have been reported in patients treated concomitant ly with orlistat and antiepileptic medicinal products e.g. valproate, LAMOTRIGINE, for which a causal relationship to an interaction cannot be excluded. Orlistat may decrease the absorption of antiepileptic medicinal products, leading to convulsions. 
> A decrease in plasma levels of AMIODARONE, when given as a single dose, has been observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat concomitantly. The clinical relevance of this effect in patients receiving AMIODARONE treatment remain s unknown. Patients who are taking AMIODARONE should consult a doctor before starting treatment with alli. The dose of AMIODARONE may need to be adjusted during treatment with alli.
