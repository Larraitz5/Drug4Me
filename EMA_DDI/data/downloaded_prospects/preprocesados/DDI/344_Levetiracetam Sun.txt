> As in adults, there is no evidence of clinically significant medicinal product interactions in paediatric patients receiving up to 60 mg/kg/day levetiracetam.  A retrospective assessment of pharmacokinetic  
7 interactions in children and adolescents with epile psy (4 to 17 years) confirmed that adjunctive therapy with orally administered levetiracetam did not influence the steady -state serum concentrations of concomitantly administered CARBAMAZEPINE and valproate. However, data suggested a 2 0% higher levetiracetam clearance in children taking enzyme -inducing antiepileptic medicinal products. Dose adjustment is not required.
> METHOTREXATE  Concomitant administration of levetiracetam and METHOTREXATE has been reported to decrease METHOTREXATE clearance, resulting in i ncreased/prolonged blood METHOTREXATE concentration to potentially toxic levels. Blood METHOTREXATE and levetiracetam levels should be carefully monitored in patients treated concomitantly with the two drugs 
> Oral contraceptives and other pharmacokinetics inter
 actions  Levetiracetam 1 000 mg daily did not influence the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives (ethinyl-ESTRADIOL and LEVONORGESTREL); endocrine parameters (luteinizing hormone and PROGESTERONE) were not modified. Levetiracetam 2 000 mg daily did not influence the pharmacokinetics of DIGOXIN and WARFARIN; prothrombin times were not modified. Co-administration with DIGOXIN, oral contraceptives and WARFARIN did not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.
