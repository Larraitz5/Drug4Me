> Due to the pharmacological effects and the mechanism of action of MEMANTINE the following interactions may occur:
- The mode of action suggests that the effects of L -dopa, dopaminergic agonists, and ANTICHOLINERGICS may be enhanced by concomitant treatment with NMDA -antagonists such as mema ntine. The effects of barbiturates and neuroleptics may be reduced. Concomitant administratio n of MEMANTINE with the antispasmodic agents, DANTROLENE or BACLOFEN, can modify their effects and a dose adjustment may be necessary.
- Concomitant use of MEMANTINE and AMANTADINE should be avoided, owing to the risk of pharmacotoxic psychosis. Both compoun ds are chemically related NMDA -antagonists. The same may be true for KETAMINE and DEXTROMETHORPHAN (see also section 4.4). There is one published case report on a possible risk also for the combination of MEMANTINE and PHENYTOIN.
- Other active substances su ch as CIMETIDINE, RANITIDINE, PROCAINAMIDE, QUINIDINE, QUININE and NICOTINE that use the same renal cationic transport system as AMANTADINE may also possibly interact with MEMANTINE leading to a potential risk of increased plasma levels.
- Ther e may be a pos sibility of reduced serum level of HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE (HCT) when mema ntine is co -administered with HCT or any combination with HCT.
- In post -marketing experience, isolated cases with international normalized ratio (INR) increases have been reported in pati ents concomitantly treated with WARFARIN. Although no causal relationship has been established, close monitoring of prothrombin time or INR is advisable for patients concomitantly treated with oral anticoagulants.In single -dose pharmacokinetic (PK) studi es in young healthy subjects, no relevant active substance -active substance interaction of MEMANTINE with GLYBURIDE/METFORMIN or DONEPEZIL was observed.In a clinical study in young healthy subjects, no relevant effect of MEMANTINE on the pharmacokineticsof GALANTAMINE was observed.5Mema ntine did not inhibit CYP 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1, 3A, flavin containing monooxygenase, epoxide hydrolase or sulphation in vitro .
