> No clinically relevant interaction of co -administered chemotherapy on bevacizumab pharmacokinetics was observed based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses. There were neither statistically significant nor clinically relevant differences in bevacizumab clearance in patients receiving bevacizumab monotherapy compared to patients receiving bevacizumab in combination with interferon alfa -2a, ERLOTINIB or chemotherapies (IFL, 5 -FU/LV, CARBOPLATIN/PACLITAXEL, CAPECITABINE, DOXORUBICIN or cispl atin/GEMCITABINE).Effect of bevacizumab on the pharmacokinetics of OTHER ANTINEOPLASTIC AGENTS
> No clinically relevant interaction of bevacizumab was observed on the pharmacokinetics of co-administered interferon alfa 2a, ERLOTINIB (and its active metabo lite OSI -420), or the chemotherapies IRINOTECAN (and its active metabolite SN38), CAPECITABINE, OXALIPLATIN (as determined by measurement of free and total PLATINUM), and CISPLATIN. Conclusions on the impact of bevacizumab on GEMCITABINE pharmacokinetics c annot be drawn.Combination of bevacizumab and SUNITINIB malate
> In two clinical trials of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA) was reported in 7 of 19 patients treated with bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every two weeks) andsunitinib malate (50 mg daily) combination.MAHA is a haemolytic disorder which can present with red cell fragmentation, anaemia, and thrombocytopenia. In addition, hypertension (including hypertensive crisis), elevated creatinine, and neurological sympt oms were observed in some of these patients. All these findings were reversible upon discontinuation of bevacizumab and SUNITINIB malate (see Hypertension, Proteinuria, PRES in section 4.4).Combination with PLATINUM -or taxane -based therapies (see sectio ns4.4 and 4.8)Increased rates of severe neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, or infection with or without severe neutropenia (including some fatalities) have been observed mainly in patients treated with PLATINUM -or taxane -based therapies in the treatment of NSCLC and m
> The safety and efficacy of concomitant administration of RADIOTHERAPY and bevacizumab has not been established.EGFR MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES in combination with bevacizumab chemotherapy regim ens
> CRC suggest that the use of anti -EGFR MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES PANITUMUMAB and CETUXIMAB, respectively, in combination with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy, is associated with decreased PFS and/or OS, and with increased toxicity compared with beva cizumab plus chemotherapy alone.
