> Co-administration of PIOGLITAZONE with GEMFIBROZIL (an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C8) is reported to result in a 3 -fold increase in AUC of PIOGLITAZONE. Since there is a potential for an increase in dose-related adverse ev ents, a decrease in the dose of PIOGLITAZONE may be needed when GEMFIBROZIL is concomitantly administered. Close monitoring of glycaemic control should be considered (see section  4.4). Co-administration of PIOGLITAZONE with rifampicin (an inducer of cytochrome P450 2C8) is reported to result in a 54% decrease in AUC of PIOGLITAZONE. The PIOGLITAZONE dose may need to be 7 increased when rifampicin is concomitantly administered. Close monitoring of glycaemic control should be considered (see section 4.4).
