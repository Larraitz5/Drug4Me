> DIURETICS  Dapagliflozin may add to the diuretic effect of thiazide and LOOP DIURETICS and may increase the risk of dehydration and hypotension (see section 4.4).
> Dapagliflozin may increase renal LITHIUM excretion and the blood LITHIUM levels may be decreased. Serum concentration of LITHIUM should be monitored more frequently after dapagl iflozin initiation and dose changes. Please refer the patient to the LITHIUM prescribing doctor in order to monitor serum concentration of LITHIUM.
> Following co- administration of dapagliflozin with rifampicin (an inducer of VARIOUS active transporters and drug- metabolising ENZYMES) a 22% decrease in dapagliflozin systemic exposure (AUC) was observed, but with no clinically meaningful effect on 24-hour urinary GLUCOSE excretion. No dose adjustment is recommended. A clinically relevant  effect with other inducers (e.g. CARBAMAZEPINE,  PHENYTOIN, PHENOBARBITAL) is not expected. 
> Following co-administration of dapagliflozin with MEFENAMIC ACID (an inhibitor of UGT1A9), a 55% increase in dapagliflozin systemic exposure was seen, but with no clinically meaningful effect on  
24-hour urinary GLUCOSE excretion. No dose adjustment is recommended.
> In interaction studies conducted in healthy subjects, using mainly a single-dose design, dapaglif lozin  did not alter the pharmacokinetics of METFORMIN, PIOGLITAZONE, SITAGLIPTIN, GLIMEPIRIDE, HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE, BUMETANIDE, VALSARTAN, DIGOXIN (a P-gp substrate) or WARFARIN (S- WARFARIN, a  CYP2C9 substrate), or the anticoagulatory effects of WARFARIN as measured by INR. Combination of a single dose of dapagliflozin 20  mg and SIMVASTATIN (a CYP3A4 substrate) resulted in a 19% increase in AUC of SIMVASTATIN and 31% increase in AUC of SIMVASTATIN acid. The increase in SIMVASTATIN and  SIMVASTATIN acid expos ures are not considered clinically relevant.
