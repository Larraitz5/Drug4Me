> Pharmacodynamic interactions  Anticoagulant therapy should be monitored, particularly during the first few days after initiating DYNASTAT therapy in p atients receiving WARFARIN or other anticoagulants, since these patients have an increased risk of bleeding complications. Therefore, patients receiving oral anticoagulants should be closely monitored for their prothrombin time INR, particularly in the fir st few days when therapy with PARECOXIB is initiated or the dose of PARECOXIB is changed (see section 4.4). 
> DYNASTAT had no effect on acetylsalicylic acid -mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation or bleeding times. Clinical trials indicate that Dynasta t can be given with low dose acetylsalicylic acid ( ï‚£325 mg). In the submitted studies, as with other NSAIDs, an increased risk of gastrointestinal ulceration or other gastrointestinal complications compared to use of PARECOXIB alone was shown for concomita nt administration o f low -dose acetylsalicylic acid  (see section 5.1). 
> Coadministration of NSAIDs and CICLOSPORIN  or TACROLIMUS has been suggested to increase the nephrotoxic effect of CICLOSPORIN  and TACROLIMUS  because of NSAID  effect s on renal PROSTAGLANDINS . Renal function should be monitored when PARECOXIB and any of these medicinal products are coadmin istered. 
> Plasma exposure (AUC and C max) to VALDECOXIB was increased (62% and 19%, respectively) when coadministered with FLUCONAZOLE (predominantly a CYP2C9 inhibitor), indicating that the dose of PARECOXIB should be reduced in those patients who are receiving FLUCONAZOLE therapy. 
> Plasma exposure (AUC and C max) to VALDECOXIB was increased (38% and 24%, respectively) when coadministered with KETOCONAZOLE (CYP3A4 inhibitor), however, a dosage adjustment should not generally be necessary for patients receiving KETOCONAZOLE. 
> The effect of enz yme induction has not been studied. The metabolism of VALDECOXIB may  increase when coadministered with enzyme inducers such as rifampicin, PHENYTOIN, CARBAMAZEPINE , or DEXAMETHASONE. 
> Effect of PARECOXIB (or its active metabolite VALDECOXIB) on the pharmac okinetics of other medicinal products  Treatment with VALDECOXIB (40  mg twice daily for 7 days) produced a 3 -fold increase in plasma  concentrations of dextromet horphan (CYP2D6 substrate). Therefore, caution should be observed when coadministering DYNASTAT a nd medicinal products that are predominantly metabolised by CYP2D6 and which have narrow therapeutic margins (e.g. FLECAINIDE, PROPAFENONE, METOPROLOL). 
> Plasma exposure of OMEPRAZOLE (CYP 2C19 substrate) 40 mg once daily was increased by 46% following administration of VALDECOXIB 40  mg twice daily for 7 days, while the plasma exposure to VALDECOXIB was unaffected. These results indicate that although VALDECOXIB is not metabolised by CYP2C19, it may be a n inhibitor of this isoenzyme. Therefore, caution shou ld be observed when administering DYNASTAT with medicinal products known to be substrates of CYP2C19 (e.g. PHENYTOIN, DIAZEPAM, or IMIPRAMINE). 
> In two pharmacokinetic  interaction studies in rheumatoid arthritis patients receiving a stable weekly methotrex ate dose (5 -20 mg/week, as a single oral or intramuscular dose),  orally administered VALDECOXIB ( 10 mg twice daily or  40 mg twice daily) had little or no  effect on the steady -state plasma concentrations of METHOTREXATE. However  caution is  advised when METHOTREXATE is administered concurrently with NSAIDs, because NSAID administration may result in increased plasma levels of METHOTREXATE.  Adequate monitoring of METHOTREXATE -related toxici ty should be considered when coadministering  PARECOXIB and methotre xate.
> Coadministration of VALDECOXIB and LITHIUM produced significant decreases in LITHIUM serum clearance (25%) and renal clearance (30%) with a 34% higher serum expos ure compared to LITHIUM alone. LITHIUM serum concentration should be monitored closely when initiating or changing PARECOXIB therapy in patients receiving LITHIUM.
