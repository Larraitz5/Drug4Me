> ZIDOVUDINE is primarily metabolised by UGT  ENZYMES; co -administration of inducers or inhibitors of UGT ENZYMES could alter ZIDOVUDINE exposure. LAMIVUDINE is cleared renally. Active renal secretion of LAMIVUDINE in the urine is mediated through organic cation transporters (OCTs); co -administration  of LAMIVUDINE with OCT inhibitors or nephrotoxic drugs may increase LAMIVUDINE exposure.

STAVUDINE/ZIDOVUDINE  In vitro antagonism of anti -HIV activity between STAVUDINE and ZIDOVUDINE could result in decreased efficacy of both drugs.

> Exacerbation of anaemia due to RIBAVIRIN has been reported when ZIDOVUDINE is part of the regimen used to treat HIV although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. The concomitant use of RIBAVIRIN with ZIDOVUDINE is not  recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4). 
> Consideration should be given to replacing ZIDOVUDINE in a combination ART regimen if this is already established. This would be particularly important in patients with a known history o f ZIDOVUDINE induced anaemia. 
> Concomitant treatment, especially acute therapy, with potentially nephrotoxic or  myelosuppressive medicinal products (e.g. systemic PENTAMIDINE, DAPSONE, PYRIMETHAMINE, co -trimoxazole, amphotericin, FLUCYTOSINE, GANCICLOVIR, interferon, VINCRISTINE, VINBLASTINE and DOXORUBICIN) may also increase the risk of adverse reactions to ZIDOVUDINE.

When possible, avoid chronic coadministration of COMBIVIR with medicinal products containing sorbitol  or other osmotic acting poly -alcohols or monosaccharide alcohols (e.g. xylitol, MANNITOL, lactitol, maltitol).  Consider more frequent moni toring of HIV -1 viral load when chronic coadministration cannot be avoided.  10 these medicinal products is necessary then extra care should be taken in monitoring renal f unction and haematological parameters and, if required, the dosage of one or more agents should be reduced.  Limited data from clinical trials do not indicate a significantly increased risk of adverse reactions to ZIDOVUDINE with cotrimoxazole (see interact ion information above relating to LAMIVUDINE and co -trimoxazole), aerosolised PENTAMIDINE, PYRIMETHAMINE and ACYCLOVIR at doses used in prophylaxis.
