> TASIGNA may be given in combination with haematopoietic growth factors such as erythropoietin or granulocyte colony -stimulating  factor (G -CSF) if clinically indicated. It may be give n with HYDROXYUREA or ANAGRELIDE if clinically indicated. 
> Concomitant administration of nilotinib with IMATINIB (a substrate and moderator of P -gp and CYP3A4), had a slight inhibitory effect on CYP3A4 and/or P -gp. The AUC of IMATINIB was increased by 18% to 39%, and the AUC of nilotinib was increased by 18% to 40%. These cha nges are unlikely to be clinically important. 
> The exposure to nilotinib in healthy subjects was increased 3 -fold when co -administered with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor KETOCONAZOLE. Concomitant treatment with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, including ketoconazol e, ITRACONAZOLE, VORICONAZOLE, RITONAVIR, CLARITHROMYCIN, and TELITHROMYCIN, should therefore be  avoided (see section  4.4). Increased exposure to nilotinib might also be expected with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors. Alternative concomitant medicinal products w ith no or minimal CYP3A4 inhibition should be considered. 
> The concomitant administration of other medicinal products that induce CYP3A4 (e.g. PHENYTOIN, CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENOBARBITAL and St. John’s Wort) is likewise likely to reduce exposure to nilotinib to a clinically relevant extent. In patients for whom CYP3A4 inducers are indicated, alternative agents with less enzyme induction potential should be selected. 
> H was markedly increased, but nilotinib absorption was only decreased modestly (27% decrease in C max and 34% decrease in AUC 0-∞). Nilotinib may be used concurrently with ESOMEPRAZOLE or other PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS as needed .
> In a study in healthy subjects, no significant change in nilotinib pharmacokinetics was observed when a single 400  mg dose of nilotinib  was administered 10  hours after and 2  hours before FAMOTIDINE. Therefore, when the concurrent use of a H2 blocker is necessary, it may be administered approximately 10  hours before and approximately 2  hours after the dose of TASIGNA. 
> 12 In CML patients, nilotinib administered at 400  mg twice daily for 12  days increased the systemic exposure (AUC and C max) of oral MIDAZOLAM (a substrate of CYP3A4) 2.6 -fold and 2.0 -fold, respectively. Nilotinib is a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor. As a result, the systemic exposure of other medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g. certain HMG -Co
> A reductase inhibitors) may be increased when co -administered with nilotinib. A ppropriate monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary for medicinal products  that are CYP3A4 substrates and have a narrow therapeutic index (including but not limited to ALFENTANIL, CYCLOSPORINE, DIHYDROERGOTAMINE, ERGOTAMINE, FENTANYL, SIROLIMUS and TACROLIMUS) when co -administered with nilotinib. 
> The absorptio n and bioavailability of nilotinib  are increased if it is taken with food, resulting in a higher se rum concentration (see sections  4.2, 4.4 and 5.2). GRAPEFRUIT JUICE and other foods that are known to inhibit CYP3A4 should be avoided.
