> Initiation of BLINCYTO  treatment causes transient release of cytokines during the first days of treatment that may suppress CYP450 ENZYMES. Patients who are receiving medicinal products that are CYP450 and transporter substrates with a narrow therapeutic index should be monitored for adverse effects (e.g. WARFARIN) or drug concentrations (e.g. CYCLOSPORINE) during this time. The dose of the concomitant medicinal product  should be adjusted as needed.
