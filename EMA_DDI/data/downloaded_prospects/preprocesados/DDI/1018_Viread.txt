NRTIs  DIDANOSINE  Co-administration of TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL and DIDANOSINE results in a 40 -60% increase in systemic exposure to DIDANOSINE . Co-administration of TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL and DIDANOSINE is not recommended (see section  4.4).
> Increased systemic exposure to DIDANOSINE may increase DIDANOSINE related adverse reactions. Rarely, pancreatitis and lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, have been reported.  Co-administration of TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL and DIDANOSINE at a dose of 400  mg daily has been associated with a significant decrease in CD4 cell count, possibly due to an intracellular interaction increasing phosphorylated (i.e. active) DIDANOSINE.  A decreased dosage of 
250 mg DIDANOSINE co-administered with TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL therapy has  been associated with reports of high rates of virological failure within several tested combinations for the treatment of HIV -1 infection.  10 Medicinal product by therapeutic areas  (dose in mg)  Effects on drug levels  Mean percent change in AUC, Cmax, C min Recommendation concerning co-administration with 245  mg TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL  ADEFOVIR DIPIVOXIL  AUC: ↔ Cmax: ↔ TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL should not be administered concurrently with ADEFOVIR DIPIVOXIL (see section  4.4).
