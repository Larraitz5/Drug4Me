> No specific interaction studies have been performed with the BIMATOPROST / TIMOLOL fixed combination.Ther e is a potential for additive effects resulting in hypotension, and/or marked bradycardia when  ophthalmic beta -blockers solution is administered concomitantly with oral CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS, GUANETHIDINE, beta -adrenergic blocking agents, parasympa thomimetics, anti -arrhythmics (including AMIODARONE) and DIGITALIS GLYCOSIDES.Potentiated systemic beta -blockade (e.g., decreased heart rate, depression) has been reported during combined treatment with CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g. QUINIDINE, FLUOXETINE, paro xetine) and TIMOLOL.Mydriasis resulting from concomitant use of ophthalmic beta -blockers and adrenaline (EPINEPHRINE) has been reported occasionally.
