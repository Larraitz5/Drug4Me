> Statins and other lipid -modifying therapy are known to increase production of PCSK9, the protein targeted by alirocumab . This leads to the increased target -mediated clearance and reduced systemic exposure of alirocumab. Compared to alirocumab monotherapy, the exposure to alirocumab is about 40%, 15%, and 35% lower when used concomitantly with statins, EZETIMIBE , and FENOFIBRATE, respectively. However, reduction of LDL -C is maintained during the dosing interval when alirocumab is administered every two weeks.
