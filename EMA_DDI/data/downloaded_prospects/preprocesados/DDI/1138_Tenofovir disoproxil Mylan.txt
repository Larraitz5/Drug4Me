NRTIs  DIDANOSINE Co-administration of TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL   and DIDANOSINE results in a  40-60% increase in systemic exposure to DIDANOSINE .  Co-administration of TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL and DIDANOSINE is not recommended (see section 4.4).
> Increased systemic exposure to DIDANOSINE may increase DIDANOSINE related adverse reactions.  Rarely, pancreatitis and lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, have been reported.  Co-administration of TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL and DIDANOSINE at a dose of 
400 mg daily has been associated with a significant decrease in CD4 cell count, possibly due to an intracellular interaction increasing phosphorylat ed (i.e. active) DIDANOSINE. A decreased dosage of 
250 mg DIDANOSINE co-administered with TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL therapy has been associated with reports of high rates of virological failure within several tested combinations for the treatment of HIV -1 infec tion.
