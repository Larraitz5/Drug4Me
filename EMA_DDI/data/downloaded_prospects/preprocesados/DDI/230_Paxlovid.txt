> Coadministration of PAXLOVID with medicinal products that induce CYP3A may decrease NIRMATRELVIR  and RITONAVIR plasma concentrations and reduce PAXLOVID therapeutic effect. 
> Medicinal products CYP3A4 substrates  PAXLOVID  (NIRMATRELVIR /RITONAVIR ) is a strong  inhibitor of CYP3A and increase s plasma concentrations of medicinal products  that are primarily metaboli sed by CYP3A. Thus, coadministration of NIRMATRELVIR /RITONAVIR with medicinal products highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associat ed with serious and/or life-threatening  events is contraindicated (see Table 1 ). Coadministration of other CYP3A4 substrates that may lead to potentially significant interaction (see Table 1) should be considered only if the benefits outweigh the risks. 
> Medicinal products CYP2D6  substrates  Based on in vitro  studies,  RITONAVIR has a high affinity for several cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms and may inhibit oxidation with the following ranked order: CYP3 A4 >  CYP2D6. Coadministration of PAXLOVID with drug subst rates of CYP2D6 may increase the CYP2D6 substrate  concentration.  
> Medicinal products P -glycoprotein substrates  PAXLOVID  also has a high affinity for P -glycoprotein (P-gp) and inhibit s this transporter ; caution should thus be exercised in case of concomitant treatment. Close drug monitoring for safety and efficacy should be performed, and dose reduction may be adjusted accordingly, or avoid concomitant use . 
> PAXLOVID  may induce glucuronidation and oxidation by CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 thereby increasing the biotransformation of some medicinal products metabolised by these pathways and  may result in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal prod ucts, which could decrease or shorten their therapeutic effect.

> A reductase inhibitors which are highly dependent on CYP3A metabolism, such as LOVASTATIN and SIMVASTATIN, are expected to have markedly increased plasma concentrations when coadministered with RITONAVIR dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a pharm acokinetic enhancer. Since increased concentrations of LOVASTATIN and SIMVASTATIN may predispose patients to myopathies, including rhabdomyolysis, the combination of these medicinal products with RITONAVIR is contraindicated  (see section 4.3). ATORVASTATIN  is less dependent on CYP3A for metabolism. While ROSUVASTATIN elimination is not dependent on CYP3A, an elevation of ROSUVASTATIN exposure has 17 Table 1: Interaction  with other medicinal products  and other forms of interaction  Medicinal product class  Medicinal product within class  (AUC change, C max Change)  Clinical comments  been reported with RITONAVIR coadministration. The mechanism of this interaction is not clear, but may be the result of transporter inhibition. When used with RITONAVIR dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent, the lowest possible doses of ATORVASTATIN or ROSUVASTATIN should be administered. The metabolism of PRAVASTATIN and FLUVASTATIN is not dependent on CYP3A, and interactions are not expected with RITONAVIR. If treatment with an HMG -Co

Plasma concentrations of MIDAZOLAM are expected to be significantly higher when MIDAZOLAM is given orally. Therefore, coadministration of PAXLOVID with orally administered MIDAZOLAM is contraindicated (see section 
4.3), whereas caution should be used with coadministration of PAXLOVID and parenteral MIDAZOLAM. Data from concomitant use of parenteral MIDAZOLAM with other PROTEASE INHIBITORS suggests a possible 3 - to 4-fold increase in MIDAZOLAM plasma levels. If PAXLOVID is coadmin istered with parenteral MIDAZOLAM, it should be done in an intensive care unit (ICU) or similar setting which ensures close clinical monitoring and appropriate medical management in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation. Dosage adjustmen t for MIDAZOLAM should be considered, especially if more than a single dose of MIDAZOLAM is administered.  
↑TRIAZOLAM (>  20-fold, 87%)  RITONAVIR coadministration is likely to result in increased plasma concentrations of TRIAZOLAM and is therefore contrain dicated (see section 4.3).  Sleeping agent  ↑ZOLPIDEM (28%, 22%) 
> ZOLPIDEM and RITONAVIR may be coadministered with careful monitoring for excessive sedative effects.  Smoke cessation  ↓BUPROPION (22%, 21%)  BUPROPION is primarily metabolised by CYP2B6. Concurrent administration of BUPROPION with repeated doses of RITONAVIR 20 Table 1: Interaction  with other medicinal products  and other forms of interaction  Medicinal product class  Medicinal product within class  (AUC change, C max Change)  Clinical comments  is expected to decrease BUPROPION levels. These effects are thought to represent induction of BUPROPION metabolism. However, because riton avir has also been shown to inhibit CYP2B6 in vitro , the recommended dose of BUPROPION should not be exceeded. In contrast to long -term administration of RITONAVIR, there was no significant interaction with BUPROPION after short -term administration of low doses of RITONAVIR (200  mg twice daily for 2  days), suggesting reductions in BUPROPION concentrations may have onset several days after initiation of RITONAVIR coadministration.  Steroids  BUDESONIDE,  Inhaled, injectable or intranasal FLUTICASONE propionat e,  TRIAMCINOLONE  Systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression (plasma cortisol levels were noted to be decreased 86%) have been reported in patients receiving RITONAVIR and inhaled or intranasal FLUTICASONE propiona te; similar effects could also occur with other CORTICOSTEROIDS metabolised by CYP3A e.g., BUDESONIDE and TRIAMCINOLONE. Consequently, concomitant administration of RITONAVIR dosed as an antiretroviral agent or as a pharmacokinetic enhancer and these gluco corticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects. A dose reduction of the glucocorticoid should be considered with close monitoring of local and systemic effects or a switch to a glucocorticoid, which is not a substrate for CYP3A4 (e.g., BECLOMETHASONE). Moreover, in case of withdrawal of GLUCOCORTICOIDS progressive dose reduction may be required over a longer period.  
↑DEXAMETHASONE 
> RITONAVIR dosed as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or as an antiretroviral agent inhibits CYP3A and as a result is expected to increase the plasma concentrations of DEXAMETHASONE. Careful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is recommended when DEXAMETHASONE is concomitantly administered with rito navir.  
↑PREDNISOLONE (28%, 9%)  Careful monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is recommended when PREDNISOLONE is concomitantly administered with RITONAVIR. The AUC of the metabolite PREDNISOLONE increased by 21 Table 1: Interaction  with other medicinal products  and other forms of interaction  Medicinal product class  Medicinal product within class  (AUC change, C max Change)  Clinical comments  
37% and 28% after 4 and 14  days RITONAVIR, respectively.  THYROID hormo ne replacement therapy  LEVOTHYROXINE  Post-marketing cases have been reported indicating a potential interaction between RITONAVIR containing products and LEVOTHYROXINE. THYROID -stimulating hormone (TSH) should be monitored in patients treated with levothyr oxine at least the first month after starting and/or ending RITONAVIR treatment.  VASOPRESSIN receptor antagonists  ↑TOLVAPTAN  Coadministration is contraindicated due to potential for dehydration, hypovolemia and hyperkalemia (see section 4.3).
