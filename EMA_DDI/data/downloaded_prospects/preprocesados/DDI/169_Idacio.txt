> 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  Adalimumab  has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic arthritis patients taking adalimumab  as monotherapy and those taking concomitant METHOTREXATE. Antibody formation was lower when adalimumab  was given together with METHOTREXATE in comparison with use as monotherapy. Administration of adalimumab  without METHOTREXATE resulted in increased format ion of antibodies, increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab (see section 5.1).  The combination of IDACIO  and ANAKINRA is not recommended (see section 4.4 “Concurrent administration of biologic DMARDs  or TNF -antagonists”). The combination of  IDACIO  and ABATACEPT is not recommended (see section 4.4 “Concurrent administration of biologic DMARDs  or TNF -antagonists”).
