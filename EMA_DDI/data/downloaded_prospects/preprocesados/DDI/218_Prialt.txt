> Ziconotide does not interact with opiate receptors. If discontinuing opiates when initiating ziconotide therapy, opiate withdrawal should be gradual. For patients being withdrawn from IT opiates, the IT opiate infusion dose should be gradually tapered over a few weeks and replaced with a pharmacologically equivalent dose of oral opiates. Adding IT ziconotide to stable doses of IT MORPHINE (see section 5.1), is possible but requires special attention, as a high rate of neuropsychiatric adverse reactions (confusion/thinking abnormal, paranoid reactions and hallucinations, and abnormal gait), some of them serious, was observed in Study 202 despite a low dose of ziconotide. Vomiting and anorexia, and peripheral oedema were also observed when IT ziconotide was added to IT MORPHINE. The addition of IT MORPHINE to stable doses of I T ziconotide is better tolerated (pruritus has been reported) (see section 5.1).  An increased incidence of somnolence has been observed when ziconotide is administered concomitantly with systemic BACLOFEN, CLONIDINE, BUPIVACAINE or PROPOFOL thus for the t ime being their simultaneous use is discouraged. 
> No data are available regarding the concomitant use of partial opioid agonists (e.g. BUPRENORPHINE) with ziconotide.
