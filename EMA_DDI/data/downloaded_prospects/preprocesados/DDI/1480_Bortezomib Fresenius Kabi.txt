> the metabolism of bortezomib, the CYP2D6 poor metaboliser phenotype is  not expected  to affect the overall disposition of bortezomib.  A drug -drug interaction study assessing the effect of KETOCONAZOLE, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib (injected intravenously), showed a mean bortezomib AUC incre ase of 35% (C I90% [1.032 to 1.772]) based on data from 12 patients. Therefore, patients should be closely monitored when given bortezomib in combination with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. KETOCONAZOLE, RITONAVIR). 
> A drug -drug interaction study as sessing the e ffect of rifampicin, a potent CYP3A4 inducer, on the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib (injected intravenously), showed a mean bortezomib AUC reduction of 45% based on data from 6 patients. Therefore, the concomitant use of bortezomib with strong  CYP3A4 induc ers (e.g., rifampicin, CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENYTOIN, PHENOBARBITAL and ST. JOHN'S WORT) is not recommended, as efficacy may be reduced. 
> A drug -drug interaction study assessing the effect of MELPHALAN -PREDNISONE on the pharmacokineti cs of bortezo mib (injected intravenously), showed a mean bortezomib AUC increase of 17% based on data from 21 patients. This is not considered clinically relevant.
