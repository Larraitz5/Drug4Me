> 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  No interaction studies have been performed  with VAXCHORA, however data and clinical experience from OTHER VACCINES can be applicable to VAXCHORA . There should be an interval of 2 hours between the administration of VAXCHORA and of typhoid vaccine Ty21a (gastro -resistant capsules) as the buffer administered with VAXCHORA may affect the tr ansit of the capsules through the gastrointestinal tract.  Concomitant administration of VAXCHORA  with systemic ANTIBIOTICS  active against V. cholerae  should be avoided  since these agents may prevent a sufficient degree of replication  to occur in order to induce a protective immune response. VAXCHORA should not be administered  to patients who have received oral or parenteral ANTIBIOTICS within 14 days prior to vaccination.  Oral or parenteral ANTIBIOTICS  should be avoided for 10 days following vaccination wi th VAXCHORA.  Data from the study of a previous CVD 103 -Hg
> R-based vaccine indicate that immune responses to VAXCHORA and protection against cholera  may be diminished when VAXCHORA  is administered concomitantly with CHLOROQUINE. Administer VAXCHORA  at least 10 days before beginning antimalarial prophylaxis with CHLOROQUINE.  There are no data regarding concomitant use of VAXCHORA with other anti-malarial drugs.  The vaccine is acid -labile and is administered with a buffer. Eating and drinking should be avoided for 
60 minutes before and after taking VAXCHORA as this may interfere with the protective effect of the buffer.
