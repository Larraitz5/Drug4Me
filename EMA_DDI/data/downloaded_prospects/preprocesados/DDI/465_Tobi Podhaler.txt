Base d on the inte raction profile for tobramycin following i ntraven ous and aerosolised administration, concurrent and/or sequential use of TOBI PODHALER  is not recommended with other medicinal products with nephrotoxic or ototoxic potential. 
> Concomitant use of  TOBI P odhaler  with diuretic compounds (such as ethacr ynic aci d, FUROSEMIDE, UREA or  intravenous MANNITOL) is not recommended. Such coumpounds can enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering antibiotic concentrations in serum and tissue. 
> See also informat ion on previous a nd concomitant use of systemic aminoglycosides and DIURETICS in section  4.4.
> Other medicinal products that have been reported to increase the potential toxicity of parenterally administered aminoglycosides include:  
- AMPHOTERICIN B, cefalot in, cic losporin, TACROLIMUS, POLYMYXINS (risk of incre ased nephrotoxicity); 
- PLATINUM COMPOUNDS (risk of increased nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity);
