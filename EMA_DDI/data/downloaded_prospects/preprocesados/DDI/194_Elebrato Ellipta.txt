> Beta 2-adrenergic blockers may weaken or antagonise the effect of beta 2-adrenergic agonists , such as VILANTEROL . If beta -blockers are required, cardioselective  beta-blockers should be considered, however, caution sh ould be exercised during concurrent use of both non -selective and selective beta -blockers .
> Caut ion is advised when co -administering with strong CYP3A4  inhibitors (e.g. KETOCONAZOLE , RITONAVIR , COBICISTAT -containing products ) as there is potential for increased systemic exposure to both FLUTICASONE FUROATE and VILANTEROL, which could lead to an increased potential for adverse reactions . Co-administration should be avoided unless the benefit outweighs the increased risk of syste mic corticosteroid adverse reactions , in which case patients should be monitored for systemic corticosteroid adverse reactions . A repeat dose study was performed in healthy subjects with the FLUTICASONE FUROATE/VILANTEROL combination (184/22  micrograms) an d KETOCONAZOLE (400 milligrams, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ). Co-administration increased mean FLUTICASONE FUROATE AUC (0-24) and C max by 36% and 33%, respectively . The increase in FLUTICASONE FUROATE exposure was associated with a 27% reduction in 0 -24 hour s weighted mean serum cortisol . Co-administration increased mean VILANTEROL AUC (0-t) and C max by 65% and 22%, respectively . The increase in VILANTEROL exposure was not associated with an increase in beta 2-agonist related systemic effects on heart rate  or blood POTASSIUM .
> UMECLIDINIUM is a substrate of cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) . The steady -state pharmacokinetics of UMECLIDINIUM was assessed in healthy volunteers lacking CYP2D6 (poor metabolisers) . No effect on UMECLIDINIUM AUC or C max was observed at a dose 8-fold higher than the therapeutic dose . An approximately 1.3 -fold increase in UMECLIDINIUM AUC was observed at 16-fold higher dose with no effect on UMECLIDINIUM C max. Based on th e magnitude of these changes, no clinically relevant drug interaction is expected when FLUTICASONE FUROATE/ UMECLIDINIUM/VILANTEROL is co -administered with CYP2D6 inhibitors or when administered to patients  who are  genetically deficient in CYP2D6 activity ( poor metabolisers). 
> FLUTICASONE FUROATE, UMECLIDINIUM and VILANTEROL are substrates of the P -glycoprotein transporter (P -gp). The effect of the moderate P -gp inhibitor VERAPAMIL (240  mg once daily) on the steady -state pharmacokinetics of UMECLIDINIUM and VILANTEROL was assessed in healthy volunteers . No effect of VERAPAMIL was observed on UMECLIDINIUM or VILANTEROL C max. An approximately 1.4 -fold increase in UMECLIDINIUM AUC was observ ed with no effect on VILANTEROL AUC . Based on the magnitude of these changes, no clinically relevant drug interaction is expected when FLUTICASONE FUROATE/ UMECLIDINIUM/VILANTEROL  is co-administered with P -gp inhibitors . Clinical pharmacology studies with a  specific P -gp inhibitor and FLUTICASONE f uroate have not been conducted. 
> Concomitant hypokalaemic  treatment with methylxanthine derivatives, steroids, or non -POTASSIUM -sparing DIURETICS may potentiate the possible hypokalaemic effect of beta 2-adrenergic agonists, therefore caution should be exercised  (see section 4.4).
