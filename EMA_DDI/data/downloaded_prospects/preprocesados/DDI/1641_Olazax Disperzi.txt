> The mean increase in olanzapine C max following FLUVOXAMINE was 54 % in female nonsmokers and 
77 % male smokers. 
> The mean increase in olanzapine AUC was 52 % and 108 % respectively. A lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using FLUVOXAMINE or any other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as CIPROFLOXACIN. 
> Decreased bioavailability  Activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral olanzapine by 50 to 60 % and should be taken at  least 2 hours before or after olanzapine.  7  FLUOXETINE (a CYP2D6 inhibitor), single doses of antacid (ALUMINIUM, MAGNESIUM) or CIMETIDINE have  not been found to sig nificantly affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine.
