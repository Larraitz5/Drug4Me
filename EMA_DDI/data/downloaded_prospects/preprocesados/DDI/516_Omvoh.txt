> No interaction studies have been performed.  In ulcerative colitis studies, concomitant use of CORTICOSTEROIDS or oral immunomodulators did not influence the safety of mirikizumab.  Population pharmacokinetic data analyses indicated that the clearance of mirikizumab was not impacted by concomitant administration of 5- ASAs  (5-AMINOSALICYLIC ACID) , CORTICOSTEROIDS or oral immunomodulators (AZATHIOPRINE, MERCAPTOPURINE, t hioguanine, and METHOTREXATE) in patients with ulcerative colitis.
