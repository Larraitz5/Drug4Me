> Substances that inhibit the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 activity (e.g. PROTEASE INHIBITORS such as INDINAVIR, LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR, RITONAVIR, SAQUINAVIR, TELAPREVIR, NELFINAVIR, BOCEPREVIR; azole antifungals including KETOCONAZOLE, ITRACONAZOLE, POSACONAZOLE, VORICONAZOLE; certain MACROLIDES such as ERYTHROMYCIN, CLARITHROMYCIN  and TELITHROMYCIN ) could decrease metabolism and increase imatinib concentrations. There was a significant increase in exposure to imatinib (the mean C max and AUC of imatinib ro se by 26% and 40%, respectively) in healthy subjects when it was co -administered with a single dose of KETOCONAZOLE (a CYP3A4 inhibitor). Caution should be taken when administering GLIVEC with inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family. 
> Substances that are inducers of CYP3A4 activity (e.g. DEXAMETHASONE, PHENYTOIN, CARBAMAZEPINE, rifampicin, PHENOBARBITAL , FOSPHENYTOIN, PRIMIDONE  or Hypericum perforatum , also known as St. John’s Wort) may significantly reduce exposure to GLIVEC, potentially increasing the risk of therapeutic failure. Pretreatment with multiple doses of rifampicin 600  mg followed by a single 
400 mg dose of GLIVEC resulted in decrease in C max and AUC (0-∞) by at least 54% and 74%, of the respective values without rifampicin treatment. Similar results were observed in patients with malignant gliomas treated with GLIVEC while taking enzyme -inducing anti -epileptic drugs (EIAEDs) such as CARBAMAZEPINE, OXCARBAZEPINE and PHENYTOIN . The plasma AUC for imatinib decreased by 
73% compared to patients not on EIAEDs. Concomitant use of rifampicin or other strong CYP3A4 inducers and imatinib should be avoided. 
> Imatinib increases the mean C max and AUC of SIMVASTATIN (CYP3A4 substrate) 2 - and 3.5 -fold, respectively, indicating an inhibition of the CYP3A4 by imatinib. Therefore, caution is recommended when administering GLIVEC with CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window (e.g. cyclospo rine, PIMOZIDE , TACROLIMUS, SIROLIMUS, ERGOTAMINE, diergotamine, FENTANYL, ALFENTANIL, TERFENADINE, BORTEZOMIB, DOCETAXEL and QUINIDINE ). GLIVEC may increase plasma concentration of other CYP3A4 metabolised drugs (e.g. triazolo -benzodiazepines, dihydropyri dine CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS, certain HMG -Co
> Because of known increased risks of bleeding in conjunction with the use of imatinib ( e.g. haemorrhage), patients who require anticoagulation should receive low -molecular -weight or standard HEPARIN , instead of COUMARIN derivatives such as WARFARIN. 
> In vitro  GLIVEC inhibits the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2D6 activity at concentrations similar to those that affect CYP3A4 activity. Imatinib at 400  mg twice daily had an inhibitory effect on CYP2D6 -mediated METOPROLOL metabolism, with METOPROLOL C max and AUC being increased by approximately 23%  (90%CI [1.16 -1.30]). Dose adjustments do not seem to be necessary when imatinib is co -administrated with CYP2D6 substrates, however caution is advised for CYP2D6 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window such as METOPROLOL. In patients treated with METOPROLOL clinical monitoring should be considered. 
> In vitro , GLIVEC inhibits paracetamol O -glucuronidation with Ki value of 58.5  micromol/l . This inhibition has not been observed in vivo  after the administration of GLIVEC 400  mg and paracetamol 
1000  mg. Higher doses of GLIVEC and paracetamol have not been studied. 
> In thyroidectomy patients receiving LEVOTHYROXINE, the plasma exposure to LEVOTHYROXINE may be decreased when GLIVEC is co -administered (see section 4.4). Caution is therefore recommended. However, the mechanism of the observed interaction is presently unk nown. 
> In Ph+ ALL patients, there is clinical experience of co -administering GLIVEC with chemotherapy (see section 5.1), but drug -drug interactions between imatinib and chemotherapy regimens are not well characterised. Imatinib adverse events, i.e. hepatotoxicity , myelosuppression or others, may increase and it has been reported that concomitant use with L -ASPARAGINASE could be associated with increased hepatotoxicity (see section 4.8). Therefore, the use of GLIVEC in combination requires special precaution.
