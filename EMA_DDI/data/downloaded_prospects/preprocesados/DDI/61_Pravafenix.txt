> There have been no formal interaction studies for PRAVAFENIX;  however the concomitant use of the active substances in patients in clinical studies has not resulted in any unexpected interactions. The following statements reflect the information available on the individual active substances (FENOFIBRATE and PRAVASTATIN). 
> Interactions relevant to PRAVASTATIN  COLESTYRAMINE/COLESTIPOL Concomitant administration resulted in approximately 40 to 50% decrease in the bioavailability of PRAVASTATIN. There was no clinically significant decrease in bioavailability or therapeutic effect when PRAVASTATIN was administered one hour before or four hours after COLESTYRAMINE or one hour before colestip ol. 
> CICLOSPORIN Concomitant administration of PRAVASTATIN and CICLOSPORIN leads to an approximately 4 fold increase in PRAVASTATIN systemic exposure. In some patients, however, the increase in PRAVASTATIN exposure may be larger. Clinical and biochemical monitoring of patients receiving this combination is recommended. 
> In one of two interaction studies with PRAVASTATIN and ERYTHROMYCIN a statistically significant increase in the area under the c urve ( AUC ) (70%) and Cmax (121%) of PRAVASTATIN was observed. In a similar study with CLARITHROMYCIN a statistically significant increase in AUC (110%) and C max (127%) was observed. Although these changes were minor, caution should be exercised when associating PRAVASTATIN with ERYTHROMYCIN or CLARITHROMYCIN. 
> FUSIDIC ACID The risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis may be increased by the concomitant administration of systemic FUSIDIC ACID with statins. The mechanism of this interaction (whether it is pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic, or both) is yet unknown. There have been reports of rhabdomyolysis (including some fatalities) in patients receiving this combination.  If treatment with systemic FUSIDIC ACID is necessary, PRAVASTATIN treatment should be discontinued throughout the duration of the fus idic acid treatment. Also see section 4.4.  
> GLECAPREVIR/PIBRENTASVIR  Concomitant use of PRAVASTATIN and GLECAPREVIR/PIBRENTASVIR may increase the plasma concentration of PRAVASTATIN and  may lead to an increase of dose -dependent adverse events including myopathy risk. Patients treated with GLECAPREVIR/PIBRENTASVIR should not exceed 20 mg per day of PRAVASTATIN. Therefore PRAVAFENIX is not recommended in those patients. 
> Oral anticoagulants  FENOFIBRATE enhances oral anticoagulant effect and may increase risk of bleeding. It is recommended that the dose of anticoagulants is reduced by about one third at the start of treatment and then gradually adjusted if necessary according to INR (International Normalised Ratio) monitoring. T his combination is , therefore,  not recommended. 
> CICLOSPORIN Some severe cases of reversible renal function impairment have been reported during concomitant administration of FENOFIBRATE and CICLOSPORIN. The renal function of these patients must therefore be closely monitored and the treatment with FENOFIBRATE stopped in the case of severe alteration of laboratory parameters. 
> Glitazones  Some cases of reversib le paradoxical reduction of HDL -cholesterol have been reported during concomitant administration of FENOFIBRATE and glitazones. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor HDL -cholesterol if PRAVAFENIX is co -administered with a glitazone and  to stop one of the  two treatments  if HDL -cholesterol is too low.
