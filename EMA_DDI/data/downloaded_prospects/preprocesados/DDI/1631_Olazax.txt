> Induction of CYP1A2  The metabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking and CARBAMAZEPINE, which may le ad to  reduced olanzapine concentrations. Only slight to moderate increase in olanzapine clearance has been  observed. The clinical consequences are likely to be limited, but clinical monitoring is recommended  and an increase of olanzapine dose may be consid ered if necessary (see section 4.2). 
> Inhibition of CYP1A2  FLUVOXAMINE, a specific CYP1A2 inhibitor, has been shown to significantly inhibit the metabolism of  olanzapine. The mean increase in olanzapine C max following FLUVOXAMINE was 54 % in female non -smokers and 77 % in male smokers. The mean increase in olanzapine AUC was 52 % and 108 %  respectively. 
> A lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using  FLUVOXAMINE or any other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as CIPROFLOXACIN.
