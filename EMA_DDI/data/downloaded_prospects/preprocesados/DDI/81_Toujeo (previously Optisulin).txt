> A number of substances affect GLUCOSE metabolism and may require dose adjustment of INSULIN GLARGINE.  Substances that may enhance the blood -GLUCOSE- lowering effect and increase susceptibility to hypoglycaemia include anti -hyper glycaemic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, DISOPYRAMIDE, FIBRATES, FLUOXETINE, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, PENTOXIFYLLINE, PROPOXYPHENE, salicylates and sulfonamide ANTIBIOTICS.  Substances that may reduce the blo od-GLUCOSE- lowering effect include CORTICOSTEROIDS, DANAZOL, DIAZOXIDE, DIURETICS, GLUCAGON, ISONIAZID, oestrogens and PROGESTOGENS, PHENOTHIAZINE DERIVATIVES, SOMATROPIN, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. EPINEPHRINE [adrenaline], SALBUTAMOL, terbu taline), THYROID HORMONES, atypical antipsychotic medicinal products (e.g. CLOZAPINE and OLANZAPINE) and PROTEASE INHIBITORS.  Beta-blockers, CLONIDINE, LITHIUM salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-GLUCOSE-lowering effect of insulin. PENTAMIDINE may cause hypoglycaemia, which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. In addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, CLONIDINE, GUANETHIDINE and RESERPINE, the signs of adrenergic counter- regul ation may be reduced or absent.
