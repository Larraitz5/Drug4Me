> CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers  Administration of the str ong CYP3A4 inhibitor KETOCONAZOLE (400  mg daily for 27  days) to healthy volunteers decreased CABOZANTINIB clearance (by  29%) and increased single -dose plasma CABOZANTINIB exposure (AUC) by  38%. Therefore, co -administration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors ( e.g., RITONAVIR, ITRACONAZOLE, ERYTHROMYCIN, CLARITHROMYCIN, GRAPEFRUIT JUICE ) with CABOZANTINIB  should be approached with caution. 
> 10 Administration of the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin (600  mg daily for 31  days) to healthy volunteers increased CABOZANTINIB clearance (4.3 -fold) and decreased single -dose plasma CABOZANTINIB exposure (AUC) by  77%. Chronic co -administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers ( e.g., PHENYTOIN, CARBAMAZEPINE, rifampicin, PHENOBARBITAL or herbal preparations containing St. John ’s Wort  
[Hypericum perforatum] ) with CABOZANTINIB  should therefore be avoided.  
> H modifying agents  Co-administration of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) ESOMEPRAZOLE (40  mg daily for 6  days) with a single dose of 100  mg CABOZANTINIB to healthy volunte ers resulted in no clinically -significant effect on plasma CABOZANTINIB exposure (AUC). No dose adjustment is indicated when gastric p
> MRP2 inhibi tors In vitro  data demonstrate that CABOZANTINIB is a substrate of MRP2. Therefore, administration of MRP2 inhibitors may result in increases in CABOZANTINIB plasma concentrations. 
> Bile salt -sequestering agents  Bile salt -sequestering agents such as CHOLESTYRAMINE and CHOLESTAGEL may interact with CABOZANTINIB and may impact absorption (or reabsorption) resulting in potentially decreased exposure (see section 
5.2). The clinical significance of these potential interactions is unknown. 
> Effect of caboza ntinib on other medicinal products  The effect of CABOZANTINIB on the pharmacokinetics of contraceptive steroids has not been investigated. As unchanged contraceptive effect may not be guaranteed, an additional contraceptive method, such as a barrier method , is recommended.  The effect  of CABOZANTINIB on the pharmacokinetics of WARFARIN has not been investigated. An  interaction with WARFARIN may be possible. In case of such combination, INR values should be monitored. 
> P-glycoprotein substrates   CABOZANTINIB was an inhibitor (IC 50 = 7.0 μM), but not a substrate, of P -gp transport activities in a bi-directional assay system using MDCK -MDR1 cells. Therefore, CABOZANTINIB may have the potential to increase plasma concentrations of co -administered substrates of P -gp. Subjects should be cautioned regarding taking a P -gp substrate (e.g.,  FEXOFENADINE, ALISKIREN, AMBRISENTAN, DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE, DIGOXIN, COLCHICINE, MARAVIROC, POSACONAZOLE, RANOLAZINE, SAXAGLIPTIN, SITAGLIPTIN, TALINOLOL, TOLVAPTAN) while receiving CABOZANTINIB .
