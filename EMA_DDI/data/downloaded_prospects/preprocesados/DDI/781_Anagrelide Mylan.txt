> CYP1A2 inducers  CYP1A2 inducers (such as OMEPRAZOLE) could decrease the exposure of ANAGRELIDE  (see section 5.2) . The consequences on the safety and efficacy profile of ANAGRELIDE are not established. Therefore, clinical and biological monitoring is recommended in patients taking concomitant CYP1A2 inducers. If needed, ANAGRELIDE dose adjustment could be made.

• ANAGRELIDE demonstrates some limited inhibitory activity towards CYP1A2 which may present a theoretical potential for interaction with other co -administered medicinal products sharing that  clearance mechanis m, e.g., THEOPHYLLINE.  
• ANAGRELIDE is an inhibitor of PDE III. The effects of medicinal products with similar properties  such as the inotropes MILRINONE, ENOXIMONE, AMRINONE, olprinone and CILOSTAZOL may be  exacerbated by ANAGRELIDE.  
• In vivo interaction studies in humans have demonstrated that ANAGRELIDE does not affect the  pharmacokinetic properties of DIGOXIN or WARFARIN.  
• At the doses recommended for use in the treatment of ET, ANAGRELIDE  may potentiate the effects of other medicinal product s that inhibit or modify platelet function , e.g., acetylsalicylic acid.  
• A clinical interaction study performed in healthy subjects showed that co -administration of  repeat -dose ANAGRELIDE 1  mg once daily and acetylsalicylic acid 75  mg once daily may enhance  the anti -platelet aggregation effects of each active substance compared with administration of  acetylsalicylic acid alone. In some patients with ET concomitantly treated by acetylsalicylic acid and  ANAGRELIDE, major haemorrhages occurred. Therefore, the p otential risks of the concomitant use  of ANAGRELIDE with acetylsalicylic acid should be assessed, particularly in patients with a high -risk profile for haemorrhage before treatment is initiated.  
• ANAGRELIDE may cause intestinal disturbance in some patients and compromise the absorption of  hormonal oral contraceptives.
