> Some patients required TOCILIZUMAB or SILTUXIMAB and/or corticosteroid for the management of CRS (see section 4.8). The use of TOCILIZUMAB or SILTUXIMAB and/or CORTICOSTEROIDS for CRS management was more common in patients with higher cellular expansion.
> MMa-3 study, patients with CRS treated with TOCILIZUMAB or SILTUXIMAB had higher ABECMA cellular expansion levels, as measured by 3.1-fold and 2.9-fold higher median C max (N = 156) and AUC 0-28days  (N = 155), respectively, compared to patients who did not receive TOCILIZUMAB or SILTUXIMAB (N = 64 for C max and N = 63 for AUC 0-28days ). Patients with CRS treated with CORTICOSTEROIDS had higher ABECMA cellular expansion levels, as measured by 2.3-fold and 2.4-fold higher median C max (N = 60) and AUC 0-28days  (N = 60), respectively, compared to patients who did not receive CORTICOSTEROIDS (N = 160 for C max and N = 158 for AUC 0-28days ).
> MMa study, patients with CRS treated with TOCILIZUMAB had higher ABECMA cellular expansion levels, as measured by 1.4-fold and 1.6-fold higher median C max (N = 66) and AUC 0-28days (N = 65), respectively, compared to patients who did not receive TOCILIZUMAB (N = 61 for Cmax and N = 60 for AUC 0-28days ). Patients with CRS treated with CORTICOSTEROIDS had higher ABECMA 11 cellular expansion levels, as measured by 1.7-fold and 2.2-fold higher median C max (N = 18) and AUC 0-28days  (N = 18), respectively, compared to patients who did not receive CORTICOSTEROIDS (N = 109 for C max and N = 107 for AUC 0-28days ).
