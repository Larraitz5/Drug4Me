> Results from clinical t rials conducted with the oral antidiabetics  PIOGLITAZONE, METFORMIN and GLYBURIDE in combination with VILDAGLIPTIN have shown no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions in the target population. 
> Drug -drug i nteraction studies in healthy subjects were conducted  with a mlodipine, RAMIPRIL, VALSARTAN and SIMVASTATIN . In these studies, no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed after co-administration with VILDAGLIPTIN.  However, this has not been established in the target population. 
> Combinations requiring precautions for use  Some medicinal products can adversely affect renal function wh ich may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, e.g. NSAIDs, including selective cyclo -oxygenase (COX) II inhibitors, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and DIURETICS, especially LOOP DIURETICS. When starting or using such products in combin ation with METFORMIN, close monitoring of renal function is necessary. 
> GLUCOCORTICOIDS, beta -2-agonists, and DIURETICS have intrinsic hyperglycaemic activity. The patient should be informed and more frequent blood GLUCOSE monitoring performed, especially at the beginning of treatment. If necessary, the dose of VILDAGLIPTIN/Me tformin hydrochloride Accord  may need  to be adjusted during concomitant therapy and on its discontinuation. 
> Angiotensin converting enzyme (A CE) inhibitors may decrease the blood GLUCOSE levels. If necessary, the dosage of the antihyperglycaemic medicinal  product should be adjusted during therapy with the other medicinal product and on its discontinuation. 
> Concomitant use of medicinal products  that interfere with common renal tubular transport systems involved in the renal elimination of METFORMIN (e.g. o rganic cationic transporter -2 [OCT2] / multidrug and toxin extrusion [MATE] inhibitors such as RANOLAZINE, VANDETANIB, DOLUTEGRAVIR and CIMETIDINE) could increase systemic exposure to METFORMIN.
