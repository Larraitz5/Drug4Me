> ABACAVIR is metabolised by UDP -glucuronyltransferase (UGT) ENZYMES and alcohol dehydrogenase; co-administration of inducers or inhibitors of UGT ENZYMES or with compounds eliminated through alcohol dehydrogenase could alter ABACAVIR exposure. ZIDOVUDINE is primarily metabolised by UGT ENZYMES; co -administration of inducers or inhibitors of UGT ENZYMES could alter ZIDOVUDINE exposure. LAMIVUDINE is cleared renally. Active renal secretion of LAMIVUDINE in the urine is mediated through organic cation transporte rs (OCTs); co -administration of LAMIVUDINE with OCT inhibitors may increase LAMIVUDINE exposure.

> In vitro  LAMIVUDINE inhibits the intracellular phosphorylation of CLADRIBINE leading to a potential risk of CLADRIBINE loss of efficacy in case of combination in the clinical setting. Some clinical findings also support a possible interaction between LAMIVUDINE and CLADRIBINE.  Therefore, t he concomitant use of lamivud ine with CLADRIBINE is  not recommended (see section 4.4).

> Exacerbation of anaemia due to RIBAVIRIN has been reported when ZIDOVUDINE is part of the regimen used to treat HIV although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. The concomitant use of RIBAVIRIN with ZIDOVUDINE is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4). Consideration should be given to replacing ZIDOVUDINE in a combinati on ART regimen if this is already established. This would be particularly important in patients with a known history of ZIDOVUDINE induced anaemia.
> Concomitant treatment, especially acute therapy, with potentially nephrotoxic or myelosuppressive medicinal products (e.g. systemic PENTAMIDINE, DAPSONE, PYRIMETHAMINE, co- trimoxazole, amphotericin, FLUCYTOSINE, GANCICLOVIR, interferon, VINCRISTINE, VINBLASTINE and DOXORUBICIN) may also increase the risk of adverse reactions to ZIDOVUDINE (see section 4.8). If concomitant therapy with TRIZIVIR and any of these medicinal products is necessary then extra care should be taken in monitoring renal function and haematological parameters and, if required, the dosage of one or more agents should be reduced. 
> Limited dat a from clinical trials do not indicate a significantly increased risk of adverse reactions to ZIDOVUDINE with cotrimoxazole (see interaction information above relating to LAMIVUDINE and co-trimoxazole), aerosolised PENTAMIDINE, PYRIMETHAMINE and ACYCLOVIR at doses used in prophylaxis.
