> Concomitant administration of the strong CYP 3A4/3A5 inducer rifampi cin altered the pharmacokinetics of eravacycline, decreasing exposure by approximately 32% and increasing clearance by approximately 54%.  The eravacycline dose should be increased by approximately 50% (1.5  mg/kg intravenous q12h) when co -administered with ri fampi cin or other strong CYP3A inducers  such as PHENOBARBITAL, CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENYTOIN and St. Johnâ€™s Wort (see sections 4.2 and 4.4) .
> Concomitant administration of the strong CYP3A inhibitor ITRACONAZOLE altered the pharmacokinetics of eravacycline, increasing Cmax by approximately 5% and AUC 0-24 by approximately 23% , and decreasing clearance. The increased exposure is not likely to be clinically significant; thus, no dose adjustment is required when eravacycline is co -administered with CYP3A inhibitors. However, patients receiving strong CYP3A inhibitors (for example RITONAVIR, ITRACONAZOLE, CLARITHROMYCIN) with a combination of factors that may increase the exposure, such as severe hepatic impairment and/or obesity should be monitored for adverse reactions  (see sections 4.4 and 4.8) .
> In vitro , eravacycline was shown to be a substrate for the transporters P -gp, OATP1B1  and OATP1B3.  A drug-drug interaction in vivo  cannot be excluded and co-administration of eravacycline and other medic inal products that inhibit these transporters ( examples of OATP1B1/3 inhibitors ; ATAZANAVIR, CYCLOSPORINE, LOPINAVIR, and SAQUINAVIR ) may increase the eravacycline plasma concentratio n.
