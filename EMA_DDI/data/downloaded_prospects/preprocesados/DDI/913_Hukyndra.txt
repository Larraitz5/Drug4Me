> Adalimumab has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic arthritis patients taking adalimumab as monotherapy and those taking concomitant METHOTREXATE. Antibody formation was lower when ada limumab was given together with METHOTREXATE in comparison with use as monotherapy. Administration of adalimumab without METHOTREXATE resulted in increased formation of antibodies, increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab (see section 5.1).The combination of adalimumab and ANAKINRA is not recommended (see section 4.4 “Concurrent administration of biologic DMARDS or TNF -antagonists”).The combination of adalimumab and ABATACEPT is not recommended (see section 4.4 “Concurrent administration o f biologic DMARDS or TNF -antagonists”).
