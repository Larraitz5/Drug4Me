> This medicinal product contains hydroxypropylbetadex, which may be available for complex formation with other medicinal products, potentially leading to an increase in bioavailability of such a product (especially medicinal products with low solubility). Therefore, it is recommended that administration of any other oral medicinal product be separated from that of MAVENCLAD by at least 3  hours during the limit ed number of days of cladribine administration. 
> At the level of cladribine absorption, the only conceivable interaction pathway of clinical relevance appears to be the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP or ABCG2). Inhibition of BCRP in the gastrointestinal tract may increase the oral bioavailability  and systemic exposure of cladribine. Known BCRP inhibitors, which may alter the pharmacokinetics of BCRP substrates by 20% in vivo, include ELTROMBOPAG.
> The effects of potent inducers of the efflux transporters BCRP and P-glycoprotein (P- gp) on the bioavailability and disposition of cladribine have not been formally studied. A possible decrease in cladribine exposure should be considered if potent BCRP (e. g. CORTICOSTEROIDS) or P-gp (e.g. rifampicin, ST. JOHN'S WORT) transporter inducers are co- administered. 
> Co-administration of cladribine with oral hormonal contraceptives (ethinylestradiol and LEVONORGESTREL) showed no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction with cladribine. Therefore, concomitant use of cladribine is not expected to decrease the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives (see section  4.6).
