> Due to the potential sensitivity of rapidly dividing myeloid cells to cytotoxic chemotherapyâ€š Cegfila  should be administered at least 24 hours after administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy. In clinical trials, pegfilgrastim has been safely administered 14  days before chemotherapy. Concomitant use of Cegfila  with any chemotherapy agent has not been evaluated in patients. In animal models concomitant administration of pegfilgrastim  and 
5-FLUOROURACIL (5 -FU) or other ANTIMETABOLITES has been shown to potentia te myelosuppression. 
> The potential for interaction with LITHIUM, which also promotes the release of neutrophils, has not been specifically investigated. There is no evidence that such an interaction would be harmful.
