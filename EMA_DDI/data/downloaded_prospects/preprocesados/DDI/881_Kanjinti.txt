> Data from study JP16003, a single -arm study of trastuzumab  (4 mg/kg intravenous  loading dose and 
2 mg/kg intravenou s weekly) and DOCETAXEL (60  mg/m2 intravenous ) in Japanese women with HER2 -positive MBC, suggested that concomitant administration of trastuzumab  had no effect on the single dose pharmacokinetics of DOCETAXEL. Study JP19959 was a substudy of BO18255 (To
> GA)  performed in male and female Japanese patients with advanced gastric cancer to study the pharmacokinetics of CAPECITABINE and CISPLATIN when used with or without trastuzumab . The results of this substudy suggested that the exposure to the bioactive metabo lites (e.g. 5 -FU) of CAPECITABINE was not affected by concurrent use of CISPLATIN or by concurrent use of CISPLATIN plus trastuzumab . However, CAPECITABINE itself showed higher concentrations and a longer half -life when combined with trastuzumab . The data also suggested that the pharmacokinetics of CISPLATIN were not affected by concurrent use of CAPECITABINE or by concurrent use of CAPECITABINE plus trastuzumab .
> By comparison of simulated serum trastuzumab concentrations after trastuzumab  monotherapy (4 mg/kg loading/2  mg/kg q1w intravenous ) and observed serum concentrations in Japanese women with HER2 -positive MBC (study JP16003) no evidence of a PK effect of concurrent administration of DOCETAXEL on the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab was found. 
> Com parison of PK results from two Phase II studies (BO15935 and M77004) and one Phase  III study  (H0648g) in which patients were treated concomitantly with trastuzumab  and PACLITAXEL and two Phase  II studies in which trastuzumab  was administered as monotherapy  (W016229 and MO16982), in women with HER2 -positive MBC indicates that individual and mean trastuzumab trough serum concentrations varied within and across studies but there was no clear effect of the concomitant administration of PACLITAXEL on the pharmac okinetics of trastuzumab. Comparison of trastuzumab PK data from Study M77004 in which women with HER2 -positive MBC were treated concomitantly with trastuzumab , PACLITAXEL and DOXORUBICIN to trastuzumab PK data in studies where trastuzumab  was administered  as monotherapy (H0649g) or in combination with anthracycline plus CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE or PACLITAXEL (Study H0648g), suggested no effect of DOXORUBICIN and PACLITAXEL on the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab. 
>  
10 The administration of concomitant ANASTROZOLE did not appear to influence the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab.
