> Since bradycardia constitutes a risk factor in the occurrence of torsades de pointes, the combination of rivastigmine with QT prolongation - or torsades de pointes -inducing medicinal products such as antipsychot ics i.e. some phenothiazines (CHLORPROMAZINE, LEVOMEPROMAZINE), BENZAMIDES (SULPIRIDE, sultopride, AMISULPRIDE, tiapride, veralipride), PIMOZIDE, HALOPERIDOL, DROPERIDOL, CISAPRIDE, CITALOPRAM, diphemanil, ERYTHROMYCIN IV, halofantrin, mizolastin, methadon e, PENTAMIDINE and moxifloxacine should be observed with caution and clinical monitoring (ECG) may also be required. 
> No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between rivastigmine and DIGOXIN, WARFARIN, DIAZEPAM or FLUOXETINE in studies in healthy volun teers.  The increase in prothrombin time induced by WARFARIN is not affected by administration of rivastigmine. No untoward effects on cardiac conduction were observed following concomitant administration of DIGOXIN and rivastigmine.
