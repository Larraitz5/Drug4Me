> REKAMBYS ,in combination with CABOTEGRAVIR injection, is intended for use as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV -1 infection and should not be administered with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of HIV -1. Therefore, information regarding drug -drug interactions with other antiretroviral medicinal products is not provided. From a drug interaction perspective, t here are no limitations on the use of other antiretroviral medicinal products after discontinuin g REKAMBYS.For the oral lead -in rilpivirine treatment and in case missed doses are replaced by oral rilpivirine treatment, refer to the oral rilpivirine tablet Sm
> Rilpivirine is primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A .Medicinal products that induce or inhibit CYP3A may thus affect the clearance of rilpivirine (see section 5.2). Co -administration of rilpivirine and medicinal products that induce CYP3A hasbeen observed to decrease theplasma concentrations of rilpivirine ,which could reduce the therapeutic effect of rilpivirine .Co-administration of rilpivirine and medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A hasbeen o bserved toincrease the plasma concentrations of rilpivirine .When using oral rilpivirine, PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS are contraindicated (see rilpivirine tablet Sm
