> Concomitant use of IMBRUVICA and medicinal products thatstrongly or moderately inhibit CYP3A 4can increase ibrutinib exposure and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided .Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors
> Co-administration of KETOCONAZOLE, a very strong CYP3A 4inhibitor, in 18 fasted healthy subjects, increased exposure (C maxand AUC) of ibrutinib by 29 -and 24 -fold, respectively. Simulations using fasted condition ssuggested that thestrong CYP3A 4inhibitor CLARITHROMYCIN may increase the AUC of ibrutinib by a factor of 14.In patient s with B -cell malig nancies taking IMBRUV ICA with food, co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor VORICONAZOLE increased C maxby 6.7 -fold and AUC by 5.7 -fold. Strong inhibitors of CYP3A 4(e.g., KETOCONAZOLE, INDINAVIR, NELFINAVIR, RITONAVIR, saquinav ir, CLARITHROMYCIN, TELITHROMYCIN, ITRACONAZOLE, nefaz odon e,COBICISTAT , VORICONAZOLE and POSACONAZOLE )should be avoided. If the benefit outweighs the risk and a strong CYP3A 4inhibitor must be used, reduce the IMBRUVICA dose to 140 mg(one capsule) for the duration of the inhibitor use or withhold IMBRUV ICA temporarily (for 7 days or less). Monitor patient closely for toxicity and follow dose modification guidance as needed (see sections 4.2 and 4.4) .8Moderate CYP3A 4inhibitors
> In patients with B -cell malignancies taking IMBRUV ICA with food, co -administration of the CYP3A4 inhibitor ERYTHROMYCIN increased C maxby 3.4 -fold and AUC by 3.0 -fold. If a moderate CYP3A 4inhibitor (e.g., FLUCONAZOLE, ERYTHROMYCIN, AMPRENAVIR, APREPITANT, ATAZANAVIR, ciprof loxacin, CRIZOTINIB, DILTIAZEM, FOSAMPRENAVIR, IMATINIB, VERAPAMIL, AMIODARONE and DRONEDARONE) is indicated, reduce IMBRUVICA dose to 280mg (twocapsules) for the duration of the inhibitor use. Monitor patient closely for toxicity and follow dose modific ation guidance as needed (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).Mild CYP3A 4inhibitors
> Simulations using fasted conditions suggested that the mild CYP3A 4inhibitor s AZITHROMYCIN andfluvoxamine may increase the AUC of ibrutinib by <2-fold. No dose adjustment is required in combination with mild inhibitors. Monitor patient closely for toxicity and follow dose modification guidance as needed.Co-administration of GRAPEFRUIT JUICE, containing CYP3A4 inhibitors, in eight healthy subjects, increased exposure (C maxand AUC) of ibrutinib by approximately 4 -and 2 -fold, respectively. Grapefruit and Seville oranges should be avoided during IMBRUVICA treatment, as these contain moderate inhibitors of CYP3A 4(see section 4.2).Agents that may decrease ibrutinib plasma concentrations
> Administration of IMBRUVICA with inducers of CYP3A 4can decrease ibrutinib plasma concentrations.Co-administration of rifamp icin, a strong CYP3A 4inducer, in 18 fasted healthy subjects, decreased exposure (C max and AUC) of ibrutinib by 92 and 90%, respectively. Avoid concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A 4inducers (e.g., CARBAMAZEPINE, rifampi cin, PHENYTOIN). Preparations containing St.John's Wort arecontraindicated during treatment with IMBRUVICA, as efficacy may be reduced. Consider a lternative agents with less CYP3A 4induction. If the benefit outweighs the risk and a strongor moderate CYP 3A4 inducer must be used, monitor patient closely for lack of efficacy (see section s4.3 and 4.4). Mild inducers may be used concomit antly with IMBRUVICA, however, patients should be monitored for potential lack of efficacy.Ibrutinib has a p
> H. A lower C maxwas observed in fasted healthy subjects administered a single 560 mg dose of ibrutin ib after taking OMEPRAZOLE at 
40mg once daily for 5 days (see section 5.2). There is no evidence that the lower C maxwould have clinical significance, and medicinal products that increase stomach p
> Ibrutinib is a P -gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) inhibitor in vitro . As no clinical data are available on this interaction, it cannot be excluded that ibrutinib could inhibit intestinal P -gp and BCRP after a therapeutic dose. To minimise the potential for an interaction in the GI tract, oral narrow therapeutic range, P -gp or BCRP substrates such as DIGOXIN or METHOTREXATE should be taken at least 
6hours before or after IMBRUVICA. Ibrutinib may also inhibit BCRP in the liver and increase the exposure of medicinal products that undergo BCRP -mediated hepatic efflux, such as ROSUVASTATIN.In studies of ibrutinib (420 mg) in combinat ion with VENETOCLAX (400 mg) in CLL patients, an increase in VENETOCLAX exposure (approximately 1.8 -fold based on AUC) was observed compared with monotherapy data for VENETOCLAX.In a drug interaction study in patients with B -cell malig nancies, a single 5 60mg dose of ibrutinib did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the exposure of the CYP3A4 substrate MIDAZOLAM. In the same study, 2 weeks of treatment with ibrutinib at 560 mg daily had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives (ethinylestradiol and LEVONORGESTREL), the CYP3A4 substrate MIDAZOLAM, nor the CYP2B6 substrate BUPROPION.9
