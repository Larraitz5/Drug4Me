> No interaction of entacapone with CARBIDOPA has been observed with the recommended treatment schedule. Pharmacokinetic interaction with BENSERAZIDE has not been studied. 
> However, in an interaction study with healthy volunteers, entacapone did not change the plasma levels of S-WARFARIN, while the AUC for R -WARFARIN increased on average by 18  % [CI 90 11–26%]. The INR values increased on average by 13% [CI 90 6–19%]. Thus, control of INR is recommended when entacapone treatment is initiated for patients receiving WARFARIN.
