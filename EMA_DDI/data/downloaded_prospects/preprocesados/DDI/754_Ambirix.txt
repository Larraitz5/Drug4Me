> No data on concomitant administration o f AMBIRIX with specific hepatitis A immunoglobulin or hepatitis B immunoglobulin have been generated. However, when the monovalent hepatitis A and hepatitis B VACCINES were administered concomitantly with SPECIFIC IMMUNOGLOBULINS there was no effect on ser oconversion rates. Concomitant immunoglobulin administration may result in lower antibody titres. 
> Concomitant administration of AMBIRIX and OTHER VACCINES than those listed above has not been studied. It is advised that AMBIRIX should not be administered at the same time as OTHER VACCINES unless absolutely necessary.  Concomitant VACCINES should always  be administered at separate injection sites and preferably into different limbs.
