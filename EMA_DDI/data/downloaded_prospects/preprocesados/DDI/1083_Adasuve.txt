> A study of inhaled loxapine and intramuscular LORAZEPAM 1 mg in combination found no significant effects on respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, blood pressure, or heart rate compared with either drug administered alone. Higher doses of LORAZEPAM have not been studied. The effects of the combination on sedation appeared to be additive.
> Caution is advised if loxapine is combined with other medicinal products known to lower the seizure threshold, e.g. phenothiazines or butyrophenones, CLOZAPINE, tricyclics or selective serotonine reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), TRAMADOL, MEFLOQUINE (see section 4.4).
> Given the primary CNS effects of loxapine, ADASUVE should be used with caution in combination with alcohol or other centrally acting medicinal products, e.g., ANXIOLYTICS, most ANTIPSYCHOTICS, hypnotics, opiates, etc. The use of loxapine in patients with alcohol or medicinal product intoxication (either with prescribed or illicit medicinal products) has not been evaluated. Loxapine may cause severe respiratory depression if combined with other CNS-depressants (see section 4.4).
> Loxapine is a substrate for flavin-containing mono-oxygenases (FMOs), and for several CYP450 isozymes (see section 5.2). Therefore, the risk of metabolic interactions caused by an effect on an individual isoform is limited. Caution should be used in patients receiving concomitant treatment with other medicinal products that are either inhibitors or inducers of these ENZYMES, particularly if the concomitant medicinal product is known to inhibit or induce several of the ENZYMES involved in loxapine metabolism. Such medicinal products may modify efficacy and safety of ADASUVE in an  
6 irregular manner. Concomitant use of CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g. FLUVOXAMINE, CIPROFLOXACIN, ENOXACIN, PROPRANOLOL and refecoxib) should be avoided, if possible.
