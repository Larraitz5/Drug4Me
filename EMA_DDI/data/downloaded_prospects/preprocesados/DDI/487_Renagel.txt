> Ciprofloxaci n In interaction studies in healthy volunteers, sevelamer hydrochloride  decreased the bioavailability of CIPROFLOXACIN by approximately 50% when co- administered with RENAGEL in a singl e dose study. Consequently, RENAGEL should not be taken simultaneously w ith CIPROFLOXACIN. 
> LEVOTHYROXINE During post marketing experience, very ra re cases of increased  THYROID stimulating hormone ( TSH ) levels have been  reported in patients co -administered sevelamer hydrochloride and LEVOTHYROXINE. Closer monitoring of TSH levels is therefore recommended in patients receiving both medicinal products.
> CICLOSPORIN, MYCOPHENOLATE MOFETIL and TACROLIMUS in transplant patients  Reduced levels of CICLOSPORIN, MYCOPHENOLATE MOFETIL and TACROLIMUS have been reported in transplant patients when coadministered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical c onsequences (i.e graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded and a close monitoring of blood concentrations of MYCOPHENOLATE MOFETIL,  CICLOSPORIN and TACROLIMUS should be considered during the use of combination and after its withdrawal. 
> PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS During post -marketing experience, very rare cases of increased phosphate levels have been reported in patients taking PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS co- administered with sevelamer hydrochloride.
