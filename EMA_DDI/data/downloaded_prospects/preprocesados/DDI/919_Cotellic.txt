> COBIMETINIB is metabolized by CYP3A and COBIMETINIB AUC increased approximately 7 fold in the presence of a strong CYP3A inhibitor (ITRACONAZOLE) in healthy subjects. The magnitude of interaction could potentially be lower in patients. 
> Avoid concurrent use of strong CYP3A inhibitors during treatment  with COBIMETINIB. Strong CYP3A  inhibitors include, but are not limited to RITONAVIR, COBICISTAT, TELAPREVIR, LOPINAVIR, ITRACONAZOLE, VORICONAZOLE, clari thromycin, TELITHROMYCIN, POSACONAZOLE , NEFAZODONE  and GRAPEFRUIT JUICE . If concomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor is unavoidable, patients should be carefully monitored for safety. For strong CYP3A inhibitors used short -term (7  days or less), consider interrupting COBIMETINIB therapy during the duration of inhibitor use.
> Co-administration of COBIMETINIB with a strong CYP3A inducer was not assessed  in a clinical study , however, a reduction in COBIMETINIB exposure is likely. Therefore, concomitant use of  moderate and  strong CYP3A inducers (e .g. CARBAMAZEPINE, rifampi cin, PHENYTOIN, and St. John’s Wort)  should be avoided. A lternative agents with no or  minimal  CYP3A induction should be considered. Given t hat COBIMETINIB concentrations are likely to be significantly reduced when co- administered with moderate to strong CYP3A inducers, patient’s efficacy may be compromised .
> COBIMETINIB is a substrate of P -glycoprotein (P -gp). Concomitant administration of P -gp inhibitors such as c iclosporin and VERAPAMIL may have the potential to increase plasma concentrations of COBIMETINIB.
