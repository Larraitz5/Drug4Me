> Doravirine is primarily metabolised by CYP3A, and medicinal products
 that induce or inhibit CYP3Aare expected to af f ect the clearance of  doravirine
 (see section  5.2). Doravirine should not be co
-administered with medicinal products that are strong CYP3A enzyme inducers as signif icant decreasesin doravirine plasma concentrations are expected to occur, which may decrease the ef f ectiveness ofdoravirine (see sections
 4.3 and  5.2).Co-administration with the moderate CYP3A inducer rif abutin decreased doravirine concentrations(see Table  1). When doravirine is co -administered with rif abutin, the doravirine dose should beincreased to 100
 mg twice daily (the doses should be taken approximately 12
 hours apart)
 (seesection  4.2).Co-administration of  doravirine with other moderate CYP3A inducers has not been evaluated
, butdecreased doravirine concentrations are expected. If  co-administration with other moderate CYP3Ainducers (e.g., dabraf enib, LESINURAD, BOSENTAN, THIORIDAZINE, naf cillin, modaf inil, telotristat ethyl)cannot be avoided, the doravirine dose should be increased to 100
 mg twice daily (the doses should betaken approximately 12
 hours apart) (see section  4.2).Co-administration of  doravirine and medicinal products
 that are inhibitors of  CYP3A may result inincreased plasma concentrations of  doravirine.
 However, no dose adjustment is needed whendoravirine is co-administered with CYP3A inhibitors.Effects of  doravirine on other medicinal products
> Doravirine at a dose of 100
 mg once daily is not likely to have a clinically relevant eff ect on theplasma concentrations of  medicinal products
 that are dependent on transport proteins f or absorptionand/or elimination or that are
 metaboli sed by CYP ENZYMES.However, c o-administration of  doravirine and the sensitive CYP3A substrate MIDAZOLAM resulted in a
18 
% decrease in MIDAZOLAM exposure, suggesting that doravirine may be a weak CYP3A inducer.Theref ore caution should be used when co
-administering doravirine with medicinal products that aresensitive CYP3A substrates that also have a narrow therapeutic window (e
.g., TACROLIMUS andsirolimus).Interaction s table5Table 1  shows the established and other potent ial medicinal product
