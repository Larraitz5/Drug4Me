> A retrospective assessment of pharmacokinetic interactions in children and adolescents with epilepsy (4 to 17 years) confirmed that adjunctive therapy with orally administered levetiracetam did not influence the steady -state serum concentrations of concomitantly administered CARBAMAZEPINE and valproate. However, data suggested a 20% higher levetiracetam clearance in children taking enzyme -inducing antiepileptic medicinal products. Dose adjustment is not required. 
> Concomitant administration of levetiracetam and METHOTREXATE has been reported to decrease METHOTREXATE clearance, resulting in increased/prolonged blood METHOTREXATE concentration to potentially toxic levels. Blood METHOTREXATE and levetiracetam levels should be carefully monitored in patients treated concomitantly with the two drugs .
