> CYP3A4 inhibitors In healthy subjects, co- administration of daridorexant 25 mg with the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor DILTIAZEM (240 mg once daily) increased daridorexant exposure parameters AUC and C max by 2.4 times and 1.4 times, respectively . In patients taking moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ERYTHROMYCIN, CIPROFLOXACIN, CYCLOSPORINE), the recommended dose of QUVIVIQ is 25 mg. 
> No clinical study was conducted with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. Concomitant use of QUVIVIQ with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ITRACONAZOLE, CLARITHROMYCIN, RITONAVIR) is contraindicated  (see section  4.3).
> CYP3A4 inducers In healthy subjects, co -administration with EFAVIRENZ (600 mg once daily ), a moderate CYP3A4 inducer, decreased daridorexant exposure parameters AUC and Cmax by 61% and 35%, respectively. 
> H- dependent. In healthy subjects, co- administration with FAMOTIDINE (40 mg), an inhibitor of gastric acid secretion, decreased daridorexant Cmax by 39% while AUC remained unchanged.   6
> Substrates of CYP 3A4 In a clinical study conducted in healthy subjects receiving daridorexant and MIDAZOLAM, a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, daridorexant at a dose of 25 mg did not affect the PK of MIDAZOLAM, indicating an absence of CYP3A4 induction or inhibition at this dose. In a clinical study conducted in healthy subjects receiving 50 mg daridorexant and MIDAZOLAM, exposure (AUC) to MIDAZOLAM increased by 42%, indicating a mild CYP3A4 inhibition. Simultaneous administration of 50 mg QUVIVIQ with sensitive CYP3 A4 substrates w ith a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., high- dose SIMVASTATIN, TACROLIMUS) should be handled with caution. In the same study, daridorexant 50 mg administered for 7 days did not induce CYP3A4, therefore contraceptives can be co- administered with QUVIVIQ. 
> In a clinical study conducted in healthy subjects receiving daridorexant 50 mg and DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE, a sensitive P -gp substrate, DABIGATRAN AUC and Cmax increased by 42% and 29%, respectively, indicating a mild P -gp inhibition. Simultaneous administration of QUVIVIQ with P-gp substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., DIGOXIN) should be handled with caution.   Alcohol In healthy subjects, concomitant intake with alcohol led to a prolonged absorption of daridorexant (tmax increased by 1.25 h). Daridorexant exposure (C max and AUC) and t Â½ were unchanged.
