> DARUNAVIR is an inhibitor of CYP3A , a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 and an inhibitor of P -gp. COBICISTAT is a mechanism based inhibitor of CYP3A, and a weak CYP2D6 inhibitor. COBICISTAT inhibits the transp orters p -glycoprotein (P -gp), BCRP, MATE1, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. COBICISTAT is not expected to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19. COBICISTAT is not expected to induce CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, UGT1A1, or P-gp(MDR1 ).Co-administratio n of DARUNAVIR /COBICISTAT and medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP3A or transported by P -gp, BCRP, MATE1, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 may result in increased systemic 8exposure to such medicinal products, which could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions (see section 4.3or table below ).REZOLSTA must not be combined with medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which increased systemic exposure is associated with serious and/or life -threate ning events (narrow therapeutic index) .Co-administration of REZOLSTA with medicinal products that have active metabolite(s) formed by CYP3A may result in reduced plasma concentrations of these active metabolite(s) potentially leading to loss of their the rapeutic effect .These interactions are described in the interaction table below .Medicinal products that affect DARUNAVIR/ cobic istat exposure
> DARUNAVIR and cobic istatare metabolised by CYP3A. Medicinal products that induce CYP3A activity would be expec ted to increase the clearance of DARUNAVIR and COBICISTAT , resulting in lowered plasma concentrations of DARUNAVIR and COBICISTAT (e.g.EFAVIRENZ, CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENYTOIN, PHENOBARBITAL,rifampicin, RIFAPENTINE, RIFABUTIN, St
> John’s Wort )(see section 4.3and interaction table below ).Co-administration of REZOLSTA and other medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A may decrease the clearance of DARUNAVIR and COBICISTAT and may result in increased plasma concentrations of DARUNAVIR and COBICISTAT (e.g.azole antifungals such as CLOTRIMAZOLE). These interactions are described in the interaction table below.REZOLSTA should not be used concurrently with products or regimens containing RITONAVIR or COBICISTAT. REZOLSTA should not be used in combination with the i ndividual components of REZOLSTA (DARUNAVIR or COBICISTAT ). REZOLSTA should not be used in combination with another antiretroviral that requires pharmacoenhancement since dosing recommendations for such combination have not been established .Interaction t able
> Expected i nteractions between REZOLSTA and antiretroviral and non-antiretroviral medicinal products are listed in the table below and are based on the identified interactions with DARUNAVIR/RITONAVIR , DARUNAVIR/COBICISTAT and with COBICISTAT .The in teraction profile of DARUNAVIR depends on whether RITONAVIR or COBICISTAT is used as pharmacokinetic enhancer, therefore there may be different recommendations for the use of DARUNAVIR with concomitant medicine . In the table below it is specified when reco mmendations for REZOLSTA differ from those for DARUNAVIR boosted with low dose RITONAVIR. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for PREZISTA for further information.The below list of examples of drug drug interactions is not comprehensive and t herefore the label of each drug that is co -administered with REZOLSTA should be consulted for information related to the route of metabolism, interaction pathways, potential risks, and specific actions to be taken with regards to co -administration.INTERA CTIONS AND DOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WITH OTHER MEDICINAL PRODUCTSMedicinal product examples by therapeutic area

Further dosage reducti on of RIFABUTIN has not been studied. It should be kept in mind that the twice weekly dosage of 150 mg may not provide an optimal exposure to RIFABUTIN thus leading to a risk of rifamycin resistance and a treatment failure.
