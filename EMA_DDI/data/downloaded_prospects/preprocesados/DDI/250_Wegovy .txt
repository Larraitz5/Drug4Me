> Semaglutide is not anticipated to decrease the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. It did not change the overall exposure of ethinylestradiol and LEVONORGESTREL to a clinically relevant degree, when an oral contraceptive combination medicinal product (0. 03 mg ethinylestradiol/0.15 mg LEVONORGESTREL) was co-administered with semaglutide. Exposure of ethinylestradiol was not affected; an increase of 20% was observed for LEVONORGESTREL exposure at steady state. Cmax was not affected for any of the compounds. 
> Semaglutide did not change the overall exposure of ATORVASTATIN following a single dose administration of ATORVASTATIN (40 mg). ATORVASTATIN Cmax was decreased by 38%. This was assessed not to be clinically relevant. 
> Semaglutide did not change overall exposure or Cmax of R- and S -WARFARIN following a single dose of WARFARIN (25  mg), and the pharmacodynamic effects of WARFARIN as measured by the international normalised ratio  (INR) were not affected in a clinically relevant manner. However, cases of decreased INR have been reported during concomitant use of ACENOCOUMAROL and semaglutide. Upon initiation of semaglutide treatment in patients on WARFARIN or other COUMARIN derivatives, frequent monitoring of INR is recommended.
