> Plasma protein binding  PRAMIPEXOLE is bound to plasma proteins to a very low (< 20 %) extent, and little biotransformation is seen in man. Therefore, interactions with other medicinal products affecting plasma protein binding or elimination by biotransformation are unlikely. As ANTICHOLINERGICS are mainly eliminated by biotransformation, the potential for an interaction is limited, although an interaction with ANTICHOLINERGICS has not been investigated. There is no pharmacokinetic interaction with SELEGILINE and LEVODOPA. 
> Combination with LEVODOPA  When PRAMIPEXOLE TEVA is given in combination with LEVODOPA, it is recommended that the dose of LEVODOPA is reduced and the dose of other anti -parkinsonian medicinal products is kept constant while increasing the dose of PRAMIPEXOLE TEVA. 
> Because of possible additive effects, caution should be advised when patients are taking other sedating medicinal products or alcohol in combination with PRAMIPEXOLE  (see section s 4.4, 4.7 and 4.8) . 
> Antipsychotic medicinal products Co-administration of antipsychotic medicinal products with PRAMIPEXOLE should be avoided (see section 4.4) , e.g. if antag onistic effects can be expected.
