> Since bradycardia constitutes a risk factor in the occurrence of torsades de pointes, the combination of rivast igmine with torsades de pointes -inducing medicinal products such as ANTIPSYCHOTICS i.e.  some phenothiazines (CHLORPROMAZINE, LEVOMEPROMAZINE), BENZAMIDES (SULPIRIDE, sultopride, AMISULPRIDE, tiapride, veralipride), PIMOZIDE, HALOPERIDOL, DROPERIDOL, cisapr ide, CITALOPRAM, diphemanil, ERYTHROMYCIN IV, halofantrin, mizolastin, METHADONE, penta midine and moxifloxacine should be observed with caution and clinical monitoring (ECG) may also be required. 
> No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between rivasti gmine and DIGOXIN, WARFARIN, DIAZEPAM or FLUOXETINE in studies in healthy volunteers. T he increase in prothrombin time induced by WARFARIN is 6 not affected by administration of rivastigmine. No untoward effects on cardiac conduction were observed following concomitant administration of DIGOXIN and rivastigmine.
