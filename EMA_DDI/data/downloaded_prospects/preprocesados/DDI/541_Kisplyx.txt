> Concomitant administration of LENVATINIB, CARBOPLATIN, and PACLITAXEL has no significant impact on the pharmacokinetics of any of these 3 substances.  Additionally, in patients with RCC the pharmacokinetics of LENVATINIB was not significantly affected by concomitant EVEROLIMUS.  Effect of LENVATINIB on other medicinal products
> A clinical drug -drug interaction (DDI) study in cancer patients showed that plasma concentrations of MIDAZOLAM (a sensitive CYP3A and Pgp substrate) were not altered in the presence of LENVATINIB. Additionally, in patients with RCC the pharmacokinetics of EVEROLIMUS was not significantly affected by concomitant LENVATINIB. No significant drug- drug interaction is therefore expected between LENVATINIB and other CYP3A4/Pgp substrates.
