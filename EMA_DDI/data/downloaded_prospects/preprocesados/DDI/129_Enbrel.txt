> Concurrent  treatment with ANAKINRA 
> Adult patients treated with ENBREL and ANAKINRA were observed to have a higher rate of serious infection when compared with patients treated with either ENBREL or ANAKINRA alone (historical data). 
> In addition, in a double -blind,  placebo -controlled trial in adult patients receiving background METHOTREXATE, patients treated with ENBREL and ANAKINRA were observed to have a higher rate of serious infections (7%) and neutropenia than patients treated with ENBREL (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). The combination ENBREL and ANAKINRA has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit, and is therefore not recommended. 
> Concurrent treatment with ABATACEPT 
> In clinical studies, concurrent administration of ABATACEPT and ENBREL resulted in increased  incidences of serious adverse events. This combination has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit; such use is not recommended (see section 4.4). 
> Concurrent treatment with SULFASALAZINE 
> In a clinical study of adult patients who were receiving established doses of SULFASALAZINE, to which ENBREL was added, patients in the combination group experienced a statistically significant decrease in
