> Ketoconazole  is mainly metabolised by cytochrome CYP3A4.  Enzyme-inducing medicinal products  such as rifampicin, RIFABUTIN, CARBAMAZEPINE, ISONIAZID, NEVIRAPINE , MITOTANE and PHENYTOIN may significantly reduce the bioavailability of ketoconazole .

> 15 * ROSUVASTATIN is not a CYP 3A4 substrate. Ketoconazole did not produce any change in ROSUVASTATIN pharmacokinetics, therefore, co -administration of ketoconazole  and ROSUVASTATIN is unlikely to increase the risk of toxicity of ROSUVASTATIN. Other statins that are not CYP3A4 substrates (PRAVASTATIN and FLUVASTATIN) can be co-administered  with ketoconazole .
> Co-administration of ketoconazole and PASIREOTIDE is not recommended since the combination can lead to a QT prolongation in patients with known cardiac rhythm disorders.
