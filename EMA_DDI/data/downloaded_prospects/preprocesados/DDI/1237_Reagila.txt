> CYP3A4 inhibitors  KETOCONAZOLE, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, caused two -fold increase in plasma exposure for total CARIPRAZINE (sum of CARIPRAZINE and its active metabolites) during short -term (4  days) co-administration, either if unbound or unbound+bound moieties considered.  Due to the long half -life of the active moieties of CARIPRAZINE a further increase in plasma exposure of total CARIPRAZINE can be expe cted during longer co- administration. Therefore, co- administration of CARIPRAZINE with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. BOCEPREVIR, CLARITHROMYCIN, COBICISTAT, INDINAVIR, ITRACONAZOLE, KETOCONAZOLE, NEFAZODONE, NELFINAVIR, posaconaz ole, RITONAVIR, SAQUINAVIR, TELAPREVIR, TELITHROMYCIN, VORICONAZOLE ) is contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
> ERYTHROMYCIN (500 mg twice daily), a moderate CY P3A4 inhibitor, caused on average a 1.4- fold (range 1.03- 2.32- fold) increase in plasma exposure of total CARIPRAZINE after 3 weeks of co-administration. Therefore, during a period of  co-administration of CARIPRAZINE with a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., ERYTHROMYCIN, FLUCONAZOLE, DILTIAZEM, VERAPAMIL), monitoring of the individual response and tolerability is recommended and, if needed, the  CARIPRAZINE dose should be  (temporarily)  reduced  to account for the potential increase in exposure . Because of the long half -life of CARIPRAZINE and its active metabolites, starting or stopping a treatment with a moderate CYP 3A4 inhibitor or changing the dose will not be f ully reflected in plasma drug levels until after several weeks. Patients should be monitored for adverse reactions and treatment response for several weeks after initiating or stopping an interacting drug or after each CARIPRAZINE dose change .
>  
7 CYP3A4 inducers  Co-administration of CARIPRAZINE with strong and moderate inducers of CYP3A4 may result in a significant decrease in total CARIPRAZINE exposure, therefore the co -administration of caripraz ine and strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENOBARBITAL, PHENYTOIN, rifampicin, St. Johnâ€™s wort ( Hypericum perforatum ), BOSENTAN, EFAVIRENZ, ETRAVIRINE, MODAFINIL, NAFCILLIN) is contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
> Given the primary CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM effects of CARIPRAZINE, REAGILA should be used with caution in combination with other centrally acting medicinal products and alcohol.
