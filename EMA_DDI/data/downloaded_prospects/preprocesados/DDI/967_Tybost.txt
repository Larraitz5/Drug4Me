> Cobicistat  is a strong mechanism -based CYP3A inhibitor and is a CYP3A substrate.  Increased plasma concentrations of medicinal products that are metabolised by CYP3A (including a tazanavir and DARUNAVIR) are observed on co -administration with cobicistat.  Co-administration of cobicistat with medicinal products that have active metabolite(s) formed by CYP3A may result in reduced plasma concentrations of these active metabolite(s) (see section 4.4).
> Cobicistat inhibits the transporters P-gp, BCRP, MATE1, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3.  Co-administration of TYBOST with medicinal products that are substrates of these transporters can result in increased plasma concentrations of the co -administered medicinal products (see section  4.4).
> Medicinal products that are extensively metaboli sed by CYP3A and have hi gh first pass metabolism appear to be the most susceptible to large increases in exposure when co -administered with cobicistat .  Co-administration of cobicistat with medicinal products such as DIHYDROERGOTAMINE, ERGOTAMINE, ergometrine, oral ly administered MIDAZOLAM, TRIAZOLAM, AMIODARONE, QUINIDINE, PIMOZIDE, LURASIDONE,  ALFUZOSIN , SIMVASTATIN,  LOVASTATIN, and SILDENAFIL wh ich are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life -threatening events is contraindicated  (see section  4.3).
> Co-administration of cobicistat with medicinal products that are strong induce rs of CYP3A (such as St. John’s wort ( Hypericum perforatum), rifampicin, CARBAMAZEPINE, PHENOBARBITAL, phenyt oin) may 7 result in decreased plasma concentrations of cobicistat and consequently that of ATAZANAVIR or DARUNAVIR being boosted, leading to loss of therapeutic effect and possible development of resistance (see section  4.3).
> Co-administration of cobicistat with medicinal products that are moderate to weak induce rs of CYP3A may result in decreased plasma concentration of cobicistat  and consequently that of ATAZANAVIR or DARUNAVIR being boosted, leading to loss of t herapeutic effect and possible development of resistance.  Some examples include, but are not limited to, ETRAVIRINE, EFAVIRENZ, NEVIRAPINE,  and BOSENTAN  (see Table  3).
> Co-administration of cobicistat with medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A may result in increased plasma concentration of cobicistat.  Some examples include, but are not limited to , ITRACONAZOLE, KETOCONAZOLE, and VORICONAZOLE  (see Table 3).
> Cobicistat co-administered with ATAZANAVIR or DARUNAVIR should not be used in combination w ith another antiretroviral agent that requires pharmacoenhancement by means of co -administration with an inhibitor of CYP3A4 to reach the desired therapeutic plasma concentrations (i.e., another protease inhibitor).  Dosing recommendations for such combinations have not been established and may result in decreased plasma concentrations of ATAZANAVIR, DARUNAVIR and/or the other antiretroviral agents that require pharmacoenhancement leading to loss of antiviral activity and development of resistance.

> 25-O-desacetyl -RIFABUTIN:  AUC: ↑ 525%  Cmax: ↑ 384%  Cmin: ↑ 394%  Co-administration of cobicistat and RIFABUTIN is not  recommended.   If the combination is needed, the recommended dose of RIFABUTIN is 150  mg 3  times per week on set days (for example Monday-Wednesd ay-Friday).  Increased monitoring for RIFABUTIN -associated adverse reactions including neutropenia and uveitis is warranted due to an expected increase in exposure to desacetyl -RIFABUTIN.  Further dose reduction of RIFABUTIN has not been studied.  It should be kept in mind that a twice weekly dose of 150  mg may not provide an optimal exposure to RIFABUTIN thus leading to a risk of RIFABUTIN  resistance and a treatment failure.
