> The inotropic effects of CARDIAC GLYCOSIDES are affected by serum CALCIUM levels. Combined use of NATPAR and CARDIAC GLYCOSIDES (e.g. ,DIGOXIN or DIGITOXIN ) may predispose patients to digitalis toxicity if hypercalcaemia develops. No drug -drug interaction study has been conducted with CARDIAC GLYCOSIDES and NATPAR (see section 4.4).For any drug that affects serum CALCIUM levels (e.g., LITHIUM, thiazides ), patients â€™serum CALCIUM levels should be monitored.Co-administration of alendronic acid and NATPAR may lead to a reduction in the CALCIUM sparing effect, which can interfere with the normali sation of serum CALCIUM. Concomitant use of NATPAR with BISPHOSPHONATES is not recommended.NATPAR is a protein that is not metabolised by and does not inhibit hepatic microsomal drug-metabolising ENZYMES (e.g. ,cytochrome P450 isoenzymes). NATPAR is not protein bound and has a low volume of distribution.7
