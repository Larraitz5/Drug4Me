4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Pharmacokinetic drug interactions  
 Remimazolam is metabolised by CES, type 1A . No in vivo drug interaction study was conducted. In vitro  data is summarised in section  5.2.  
 Pharmacodynamic drug interactions  
 Increased sedation with CNS depressants and o pioids  The co -administration of remimazolam with opioids and CNS depressants, including alcohol, is likely to result in enhanced sedation and cardiorespiratory depression. Examples include opiate derivatives (used as analgesics, antitussives or substitutive treatments), antipsychotics, other benzodiazepines 6 (used as anxiolytics or hypnotics ), barbiturates, propofol, ketamine, etomidate; sedative antidepressants, non recent H1 -antihistamines and centrally acting antihypertensive medicinal products . 
 Concomitant use of remimazolam and opioids may result in profound sedation and respiratory depression. Patients should be m onitor ed for respiratory depression and depth of sedation (see section s 4.2 and 4.4). 
 Alcohol intake should be avoided for 24 hours before remimazolam administration since it may markedly enhance the sedative effect of remimazolam  (see section  4.4).
