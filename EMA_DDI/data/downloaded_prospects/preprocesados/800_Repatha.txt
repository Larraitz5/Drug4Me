4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No interaction studies have been performed . 
 The pharmacokinetic interaction between statins and evolocumab  was evaluated in the clinical trials. An approximately  20% increase in the clearance of evolocumab was observed in patients co -administered statins. This increased clearance is in part mediated by statins increasing the concentration of Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type  9 (PCSK9) which did not adversely impact the pharmacodynamic effect of evolocumab on lipids. No statin dose adjustments are necessary when used in combination with evolocumab . 
 No studies on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics interaction between evolocumab  and lipid -lowering medicinal products other than statins and ezetimibe have been conducted.
