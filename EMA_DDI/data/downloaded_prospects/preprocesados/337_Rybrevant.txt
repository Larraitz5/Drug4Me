 G1 monoclonal antibody, renal excretion and hepatic enzyme -mediated metabolism of intact amivantamab are unlikely to bemajor elimination routes. As such, variations in drug -metabolising enzymes are not exp ected to affect the elimination of amivantamab. Due to the high affinity to a unique epitope on EGFR and MET, amivantamab is not anticipated to alter drug -metabolising enzymes.Vaccin es 
 No clinical data are available on the efficacy and safety of vaccinat ions in patients takingamivantamab. Avoid the use of live or live -attenuated vaccines while patients are taking amivantamab.
