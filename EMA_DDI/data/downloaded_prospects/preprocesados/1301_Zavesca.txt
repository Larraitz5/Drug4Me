4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 Limited data suggest that co -administration of Zavesca and enzyme replacement with imiglucerase in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease may result in decreased exposure to miglustat (approximate reductions of 22% in C maxand 14% in AUC were observed in a small parallel -group study). This study alsoindicated that Zavesca has no or limited effect on the pharmacokinetics of imiglucerase .
