4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.  
 Based on the results of in vitro experiments and the known elimination pathway of tenofovir, the potential for CYP450 mediated interactions involving tenofovir with other medicinal products is low.  
 Concomitant use not recommended  Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva  should not be administered concomitantly with other medicinal products containing tenofovir disoproxil  or tenofovi r alafenamide.  
 Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva  should not be administered concomitantly with adefovir dipivoxil.  
 Didanosine  Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine is not recommended (see section 4.4 and Table 
1). 
 Renally eliminated medicinal products  Since tenofovir is primarily eliminated by the kidneys,  co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil with medicinal products that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion via transport proteins h 
 OAT 1, h 
 OAT 3 or MRP 4 (e.g. cidofovir) may increase serum concentrations of tenofovir and/or the co- administered medicinal products.  
 Use of tenofovir disoproxil  should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a  nephrotoxic medicinal product. Some examples include, but are not limited to, aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, foscarnet, ganciclovir, pentamidine, vancomycin, cidofovir or interleukin- 2 (see section 4.4).  
 Given that tacrolimus can affect renal function, close monitoring is recommended when it is co-adminis tered with tenofovir disoproxil . 
 Other interactions  Interactions between tenofovir disoproxil  and other  medicinal products  are listed in Table 1 below (increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “ ↔”, twice daily as “b.i.d.”, and once dail y as “q.d.”).

The increased exposure of tenofovir could potentiate tenofovir -associated adverse events, including renal disorders. Renal function should be closely  monitored (see section 4.4).  Lopinavir/Ritonavir  (400 mg b.i.d./100 mg b.i.d.)  Lopinavir/ritonavir:  No significant effect on lopinavir/ritonavir  PK parameters.  Tenofovir:  AUC: ↑ 32%  Cmax: ↔ Cmin: ↑ 51%  No dose adjustment is  recommended. The increased exposure of tenofovir could potentiate tenofovir -associated adverse events, including renal disorders. Renal function should be closely  monitored (see section 4.4).  Darunavir/Ritonavir  (300 mg/100 mg b.i.d.)  Darunavir:  No significant effect on darunavir/ritonavir  PK parameters.  Tenofovir:  AUC: ↑ 22%  Cmin: ↑ 37%  No dose adjustment is  recommended. The increased exposure of tenofovir could potentiate tenofovir -associated adverse events, including renal disorders.

245 mg  tenofovir disoproxil  
 NRTIs  Didanosine  Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine results in a 40-60% increase in systemic exposure to didanosine . Co-administration of  tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine is not recommended  (see section 4.4).  
 Increased systemic exposure to didanosine may increase didanosine related adverse reactions. Rarely, pancreatitis and lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, have been reported. Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine at a dose of 400 mg daily h as been associated with a significant decrease in CD4 cell count, possibly due to an intracellular interaction increasing phosphorylated (i.e. active) didanosine. A decreased dosage of 250 mg didanosine co -administered with tenofovir disoproxil therapy has  been associated with reports of high rates of virological failure within several tested combinations for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.  Adefovir dipivoxil  AUC: ↔ Cmax: ↔ Tenofovir disoproxil  should not be administered concurrently with adefovir dipivoxil  (see section 4.4).  14  Medicinal product by therapeutic areas  (dose in  mg) Effects on drug levels  Mean percent change in AUC, C max, Cmin Recommendation concerning  co-administration with

3 Study conducted with additional voxilaprevir 100 mg to achieve voxilaprevir exposures expected in HCV- infected patients.  
 Studies conducted with other medicinal products  There were no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions when tenofovir disoproxil  was co -administered with emtricitabine, lamiv udine, indinavir, efavirenz, nelfinavir, saquinavir (ritonavir boosted), methadone, ribavirin, rifampicin, tacrolimus, or the hormonal contraceptive norgestimate/ethinyl oestradiol.  
 Tenofovir disoproxil  must be taken with food, as food enhances the bioava ilability of tenofovir (see section 5.2).
