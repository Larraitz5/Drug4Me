4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 Hydrocortisone interactions listed below have been reported after therapeutic doses of glucocorticoids.Potent CYP 3A4 inducer s such as phenytoin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, barbiturates, rifampicin, St.Johnâ€™s wort and less potent inducers such as the antiretroviral medicinal products efavirenz and nevirapine can enhance the metabolic clearance of cortisol, decrease terminal half -life and thus reduce circulating levels and increase fluctuations of cortisol (due to shorter terminal half -life). This may require dos e adjustment of hydrocortisone.Potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole erythromycin, telithromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir and grapefruit juice can inhibit the metabolism of hydrocortisone, and thus increase blood levels. During long -term prophylactic treatment with any of the antibiotics, adjustment of the hy drocortisone dosage should be considered.The effect of corticosteroids may be reduced for 3 -4days after treatment with mifepristone.The clinical response needs to be monitored in patients given medicinal products affecting gastric emptying and motilit y, see section 4.4.
