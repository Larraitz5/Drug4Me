4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Kaletra contains lopinavir and ritonavir, both of which are inhibitors of the P450 isoform CYP3A invitro.  Co -administration of Kaletra and medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP3A may result in increased plasma concentrations of the other medici nal product, which could increase or prolong its therapeutic and adverse reactions.  Kaletra does not inhibit CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, CYP2B6 or CYP1A2 at clinically relevant concentrations (see section 4.3).Kaletra has been shown invivo to indu ce its own metabolism and to increase the biotransformation of some medicinal products metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes (including CYP2C9 and 11CYP2C19) and by glucuronidation.  This may result in lowered plasma concentrations and potential decrease of efficacy of co -administered medicinal products.Medicinal products that are contraindicated specifically due to the expected magnitude of interaction and potential for serious adverse events are listed in section 4.3.Known and theoretical interactions with selected antiretrovirals and non -antiretroviral medicinal products are listed in the table below.   This list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive.  Individual Sm 
 PCs should be consulted.Interaction table

 Cmax: ↑ 1.8 -fold 
 Due to P -gp and/or CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir.Concomitant administration of Kaletra with colchicine in patients with renal and/or hepatic impair ment is contraindicated due to a potential increase of colchicine -related serious and/or life-threatening reactions such as neuromuscular toxicity (including rhabdomyolysis) (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).  A reduction in colchicine dosage or an interruption of colchicine treatment is recommended in patients with normal renal or hepatic function if treatment with Kaletra is required.  Refer to colchicine prescribinginformation.Antihistamines 
 Astemizole 
 Terfenadine 
 Serum concentrations may be increased due to CYP3A inhibition by lopinavir/ritonavir.Concomitant administration of Kaletra and astemizole and terfenadine is contraindicated as it may incr ease the risk of serious arrhythmias from these agents (see section 4.3).Anti-infectives 
 Fusidic acid Fusidic acid:Concentrations may be increased due to CYP3A inhibition by lopinavir/ritonavir.Concomitant administration of Kaletra with fusidic acid is contra -indicated in dermatological indications due to the increased risk of adverse events related to fusidic acid, notably rhabdomyolysis (see section 4.3).  When used for osteo -articular infectio ns, where the co -administration is unavoidable, close clinical monitoring for muscular adverse events is strongly recommended (see section 
4.4). Antimycobacterials 
 Bedaquiline(single dose)(Lopinavir/ritonavir 
400/100 mg BID, multiple dose)Bedaquiline:AUC: ↑22%Cmax: ↔A more pronounced effect on bedaquiline plasma exposures may be observed during prolonged co -administration with lopinavir/ritonavir.CYP3A4 inhibition likely due to lopinavir/ritonavir.Due to the risk of bedaquiline related adverse events, the combination of bedaquiline and Kaletra should be avoided.  If the benefit outweighs the risk, co-administration of bedaquiline with Kaletra must be done with caution.  More frequent electrocardiogram monitoring and monitoring of transaminases is recommended (see section 4.4 and refer to the bedaquiline Sm 
 PC).19Dela manid (100 mg BID)(Lopinavir/ritonavir 
400/100 mg BID)Dela manid:AUC: ↑ 22%DM-6705 (delamanid active metabolite):AUC: ↑ 30%A more pronounced effect on DM-6705 exposur e may be observed during prolonged co -administration with lopinavir/ritonavir.Due to the risk of QTc prolongation associated with DM -6705, if co-administration of delamanid with Kaletra is considered necessary, very frequent ECG monitoring througho ut the full delamanid treatment period is recommended (see section 4.4 and refer to the delamanid Sm 
 PC).Rifabutin, 150 mg QD Rifabutin (parent drug and active 
25-O-desacetyl metabolite) :AUC: ↑ 5.7 -fold 
 Cmax: ↑ 3.5 -fold When given with Kaletra the recommended dose of rifabutin is 
150mg 3 times per week on set days (for example Monday -Wednesday -Friday).  Increased monitoring for rifabutin -associated adverse reactions including neutropenia and uveitis is warranted due to a n expected increase in exposure to rifabutin.  Further dosage reduction of rifabutin to 150 mg twice weekly on set days is recommended for patients in whom the 150 mg dose 3 times per week is not tolerated.  It should be kept in mind that the twice weekly dosage of 150 mg may not provide an optimal exposure to rifabutin thus leading to a risk of rifamycin resistance and a treatment failure.  No dose adjustment is needed for Kaletra. 20Rifampicin Lopinavir:Large decreases in lopinavir concentrations may be observed due to CYP3A induction by rifampicin.Co-administration of Kaletra with rifampicin is not recommended as the decrease in lopinavir concentrations may in turn significantly decrease the lopinavir therapeutic effect .  A dose adjustment of Kaletra 
400mg/400 mg (i.e. Kaletra 
400/100 mg + ritonavir 300 mg) twice daily has allowed compensating for the CYP 3A4 inducer effect of rifampicin.  However, such a dose adjustment might be associated with ALT/AST elevations and with increase in gastrointestinal disorders.  Ther efore, this co -administration should be avoided unless judged strictly necessary.  If this co-administration is judged unavoidable, increased dose of Kaletra at 400 mg/400 mg twice daily may be administered with rifampicin under close safe ty and therapeutic drug monitoring.  The Kaletra dose should be titrated upward only after rifampicin has been initiated (see section 4.4).Antipsychotics

 Midazolam Oral Midazolam: AUC: ↑ 13-fold Parenteral Midazolam:AUC: ↑ 4-fold 
 Due to CYP3A inhibition by lopinavir/ritonavir 
 Kaletra must not be co -administered with oral midazolam (see section 
4.3), whereas caution should be used with co -administration of Kaletra and parenteral midazolam.  If Kaletra is co -administered with parenteral midazol am, it should be done in an intensive care unit (ICU) or similar setting which ensures close clinical monitoring and appropriate medical management in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation.  Dosage adjustment for midazolam should be considered especially if more than a single dose of midazolam is administered.Beta2-adrenoceptor agonist (long acting)Salmeterol Salmeterol:Concentrations are expected to increase due to CYP3A inhibition by lopinavir/ritonavir.The combination may result in increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events associated with salmeterol, including QT prolongation, palpitations and sinus tachycardia.Ther efore, concomitant administration of Kaletra with salmeterol is not recommended (see section 4.4).Calcium channel blockers 
 Felodipine, Nifedipine, and Nicardipine 
 Felodipine, Nifedipine, Nicardipine:Concentrations may be increased due to CYP3A inhibition by lopinavir/ritonavir.Clinical monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is recommended when these medicines are concomitantly administered with Kaletra.Corticosteroids 
 Dexa methasone Lopinavir:Concentrations may be decreased due to CYP3A induction by dexa methasone.Clinical monitoring of antiviral efficacy is recommended when these medicines are concomitantly administered with Kaletra.22Inhaled, injectable or intranasal fluticasone propionate, budesonide, triamcinolone 
 Fluticasone propionate, 50 g intranasal 4 times daily:Plasma concentrations ↑Cortisol levels ↓ 86% Greater effects may be expected when fluticasone propionate is inhaled.  Systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression have been reported in patients receiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasally administered flutic asone propionate; this could also occur with other corticosteroids metabolised via the P450 3A pathway e.g. budesonide and triamcinolone.  Consequently, concomitant administration of Kaletra and these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 
4.4).  A dose reduction of the glucocorticoid should be considered with close monitoring of local and systemic effects or a switch to a glucocorticoid, which is not a substrate for CYP3A4 (e.g. beclomethasone).  Moreover, in case of withdrawal of glucocorticoids progressive dose reduction may have to be performed over a longer period.  Phosphodiesterase(PDE5) inhibitors

Rosuvastatin, 20 mg QD Rosuvastatin:AUC: ↑ 2-fold Cmax: ↑ 5-fold 
 While rosuvastatin is poorly metabolised by CYP3A4, an increase of its plasma concentrations was observed.  The mechanism of this interaction may result from inhibition of transport proteins.Caution should be exercised and reduced doses should be considered when Kaletra is co-administered with rosuvastatin (see section 4.4).26Fluvastatin or Pravastatin Fluvastatin, Pravastatin: No clinical relevant interaction expected.Pravastatin is not metabolised by CYP450.Fluvastatin is partially metabolised by CYP2C9.If treatment with an HMG -Co 
 A reductase inhibitor is indicated, fluvastatin or pravastatin is recommended.Opioids 
 Buprenorphine, 16 mg QD Buprenorphine: ↔ No dose adjustment necessary.Methadone Methadone: ↓ Monitoring plasma concentrations of methadone is recommended.Oral contraceptives 
 Ethinyl Oestradiol Ethinyl Oestradiol: ↓ In case of co -administration of Kaletra with contraceptives containing ethinyl oestradiol (whatever the contraceptive formulation e.g. oral or patch), additional methods of contraception must be used.Smoking cessation aids 
 Bupropion Buproprion and its active metabolite, hydroxybupropion:AUC and C max ↓ ~50% This effect may be due to induction of bupropion metabolism.If the co -administration of Kaletra with bupropion is judged unavoidable, this should be done under close clinical monitoring for bupropion efficacy, without exceeding the recommended dosage, despite the observed induction.Thyroid hormone replacement therapy 
 Levothyroxine Post-marketing cases have been reported indicating a potential interaction between ritonavir containing products and levothyroxine.Thyroid -stimulating hormone (TSH) should be monitored in patients treated with levothyroxine at least the first month after starting and/or ending lopinavi r/ritonavir treatment.Vasodilating agents 
 Bosentan Lopinavir -ritonavir:Lopinavir/ritonavir plasma concentrations may decrease due to CYP3A4 induction by bosentan.Bosentan:AUC: ↑ 5-fold Cmax: ↑ 6-fold 
 Initially, bosentan C min: ↑by approximately 48 -fold.Due to CYP3A4 inhibition by lopinavir/ritonavir.Caution should be exercised in administering Kaletra with bosentan.When Kaletra is administered concomitantly with bosentan , the efficacy of the HIV therapy should be monitored a nd patients should be closely observed for bosentan toxicity, especially during the first week of co -administration.  Riociguat Serum concentrations may be increased due to CYP3A and P-gp inhibition by lopinavir/ritonavir.The co -administration of riociguat with Kaletra is not recommended (see section 4.4 and refer to riociguat Sm 
 PC).27Other medicinal products 
 Based on known metabolic profiles, clinically significant interactions are not expected between Kaletra and dapsone, trimethoprim/sulfametho xazole, azithromycin or fluconazole.
