4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 No formal interaction studies with tenecteplase and medicinal products commonly administered in patients with AMI have been performed. However, the analysis of data from more than 1 2000patients treated during phase I, II and III did not reveal any clinically relevant interactions with medicinal products commonly used in patients with AMI and concomitantly used with tenecteplase .Drugs affecting coagulation/platelet function 
 Medic inal products that affect coagulation or those that alter platelet function (e.g. ticlopidine, clopidogrel, LMWH) may increase the risk of bleeding prior to, during or after tenecteplase therapy.Concomitant use of GPIIb/IIIa antagonists increases bleedin g risk.6
