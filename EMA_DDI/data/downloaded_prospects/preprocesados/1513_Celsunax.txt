4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 No inte raction studies have been performed in humans.  
 Ioflupane binds to the dopamine transporter. Active substances  that bind to the dopamine transporter with high affinity may therefore interfere with Celsunax  diagnosis. These include :  
- amfetamine,  
- benzatropine,  
- buproprion,  
- cocaine,  
- mazindol,  
- methylphenidate,  
- phentermine , 
- sertraline.  
 Active substances  shown during clinical studies not to interfere with Celsunax  imaging include :  5 - amantadine,  
- trihexyphenidyl,  
- budipine,  
- levodopa,  
- metoprolol,  
- primidone,  
- propranolol , 
- selegiline.  
 Dopamine agonists and antagonists acting on the postsynaptic dopamine receptors are not expected to interfere with  Celsunax  imaging  and can therefore  be continued  if desired.  Medicinal  products  shown  in animal studies not to interfere with Celsunax  imaging include  pergolide.
