4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Abrysvo can be administered concomitantly with seasonal quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV, surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted). In a randomised study in adults 65 years of ag e and older, the criteria for non -inferiority of the immune responses in the co -administration versus the separate administration group were met. However, numerically lower RSV  A and  B neutralising titres and numerically lower influenza  A and  B haemaggluti nation inhibition titres were observed when Abrysvo and inactivated adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine were co -administered than when they were administered separately. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown.  
 A minimum  interval of two weeks is recommended between administration of Abrysvo and administration of a tetanus, diphtheria and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap). There were no safety concerns when Abrysvo was co-administered with Tdap in  healthy non -pregnant women. Immune response s to RSV  A, RSV  B, diphtheria and tetanus  on co -administration were non-inferior to th ose after separate administration . However, the immune responses to the pertussis component s were lower on co -administration compared to separate administration a nd did not meet the criteria for non -inferiority. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown.
