4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Hydrocortisone is metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Concomitant administration of medicinal pro ducts that are inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 may therefore lead to unwanted alterations in serum concentrations of hydrocortisone  with the risk of adverse  reactions , particularly adrenal crisis. The need for dose adjustment when such medicinal products are used can be anticipated and patients should be closely monitored.

- Anticonvulsants: phenytoin, carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine  
- Antibiotics: rifampicin and rifabutin  
- Barbiturates including phenobarbital and primidone  
- Antiretroviral medicinal products: efavirenz and nevirapine
