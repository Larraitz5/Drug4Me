4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 The clinical results obtained so far do not indicate any interaction of darbepoetin alfa with other substances.  However, there is potential for an interaction with substances that are highly bound to red blood cells e.g. cyclosporin, tacrolimus.  If Aranesp  is given concomitantly with any of these treatments, blood levels of these substances should be monitored and the dosage adjusted as the haemoglobin rises.
