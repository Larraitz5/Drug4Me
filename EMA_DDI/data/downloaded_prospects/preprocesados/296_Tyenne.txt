4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.  
 Concomitant administration of a single dose of 10 mg/kg tocilizumab with 10-25 mg MTX once weekly had no clinically signific ant effect on MTX exposure.  
 Population pharmacokinetic analyses did not detect any effect of MTX, non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids on tocilizumab clearance.  
 The expression of hepatic CYP450 enzymes is suppressed by cytoki nes, such as IL -6, that stimulate chronic inflammation. Thus, CYP450 expression may be reversed when potent cytokine inhibitory therapy, such as tocilizumab, is introduced.  
 In vitro studies with cultured human hepatocytes demonstrated that IL -6 caused a r eduction in CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 enzyme expression. Tocilizumab normalises expression of these enzymes.  
 In a study in RA patients, levels of simvastatin (CYP3A4) were decreased by 57% one week following a single dose of tocilizumab, to the l evel similar to, or slightly higher than, those observed in healthy subjects.  
 When starting or stopping therapy with tocilizumab , patients taking medicinal products which are individually adjusted and are metabolised via CYP450 3A4, 1A2 or 2C9 (e.g. methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, (with the possibility for oral glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome), atorvastatin, calcium channel blockers, theophylline, warfarin, phenprocoumon, phenytoin, ciclosporin, or benzodiazepines) should be monitored as doses may ne ed to be increased to maintain therapeutic effect. Given its long elimination half -life (t1/2), the effect of tocilizumab on CYP450 enzyme activity may persist for several weeks after stopping therapy.
