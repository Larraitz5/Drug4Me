4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms o f interaction  
 No interaction studies have been performed. Based on the potential inhibitory effect of ravulizumab on complement -dependent cytotoxicity of rituximab, ravulizumab may reduce the expected pharmacodynamic effects of rituximab.  
 Chronic intravenous human immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment may interfere with the endosomal neonatal Fc receptor (Fc 
 Rn) recycling mechanism of monoclonal antibodies such as ravulizumab and thereby decrease serum ravulizumab concentrations.  
 See section 4.2 for guidance in case of concomitant PE, PP, or IVIg treatment.
