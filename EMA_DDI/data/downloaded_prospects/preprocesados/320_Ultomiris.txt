 No interaction studies have been performed.  Based on the potential inhibitory effect of ravulizumab on complement -dependent cytotoxicity of rituximab, ravulizumab may reduce the expected pharmacodynamic effects of rituximab.  See section 4.2 for guidance in case of concomitant PE, PP, or IVIg treatment.
