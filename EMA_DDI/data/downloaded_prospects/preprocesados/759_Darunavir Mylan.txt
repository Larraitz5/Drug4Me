4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.  
 Medicinal products that may be affected by darunavir boos ted with ritonavir  
 Darunavir and ritonavir are inhibitors of CYP3A, CYP2D6 and P -gp. Co -administration of darunavir/ ritonavir with medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP3A and/or CYP2D6 or transported by P-gp may result in increased systemic exp osure to such medicinal products, which could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions.  9  Co-administration of darunavir/ritonavir with drugs that have active metabolite(s) formed by CYP3A may result in reduced plasma concentration s of these active metabolite(s), potentially leading to loss of their therapeutic effect (see the Interaction table below).  
 Darunavir co -administered with low dose ritonavir must not be combined with medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP3A f or clearance and for which increased systemic exposure is associated with serious and/or life -threatening events (narrow therapeutic index) (see section 4.3).  
 The overall pharmacokinetic enhancement effect by ritonavir was an approximate 14 -fold increase in the systemic exposure of darunavir when a single dose of 600 mg darunavir was given orally in combination with ritonavir at 100 mg twice daily. Therefore, darunavir must only be used in combination with low dose ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic e nhancer (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).  
 A clinical study utilising a cocktail of medicinal products that are metabolised by cytochromes CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 demonstrated an increase in CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 activity and inhibition of CYP2D6 activity in the  presence of darunavir/ritonavir, which may be attributed to the presence of low dose ritonavir. Co -administration of darunavir and ritonavir with medicinal products which are primarily metabolised by CYP2D6 (such as flecainide, propafenone, metoprolol) ma y result in increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products, which could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions. Co -administration of darunavir and ritonavir with medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP2C9 (s uch as warfarin) and CYP2C19 (such as methadone) may result in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could decrease or shorten their therapeutic effect.  
 Although the effect on CYP2C8 has only been studied in vitro , co-administratio n of darunavir and ritonavir and medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP2C8 (such as paclitaxel, rosiglitazone, repaglinide) may result in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could decrease or shorten their therapeutic eff ect. 
 Ritonavir inhibits the transporters P -glycoprotein, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, and co -administration with substrates of these transporters can result in increased plasma concentrations of these compounds (e.g. dabigatran etexilate, digoxin, statins and bos entan; see the Interaction table below).  
 Medicinal products that affect darunavir/ritonavir exposure  Darunavir and ritonavir are metabolised by CYP3A. Medicinal products that induce CYP3A activity would be expected to increase the clearance of darunavir a nd ritonavir, resulting in lowered plasma concentrations of darunavir and ritonavir (e.g. rifampicin, St John’s wort, lopinavir).  Co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir and other medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A may decrease the clearance of dar unavir and ritonavir and may result in increased plasma concentrations of darunavir and ritonavir (e.g. indinavir, azole antifungals like clotrimazole). These interactions are described in the interaction table below.  
 Interaction table  
 Interactions betwe en darunavir/ritonavir and antiretroviral and non -antiretroviral medicinal products are listed in the table below. The direction of the arrow for each pharmacokinetic parameter is based on the 90% confidence interval of the geometric mean ratio being withi n (↔), below (↓) or above (↑) the 80 -125% range (not determined as “ND”).  
 Several of the interaction studies (indicated by # in the table below) have been performed at lower than recommended doses of darunavir or with a different dosing regimen (see secti on 4.2 Posology). The effects on co -administered medicinal products may thus be underestimated and clinical monitoring of safety may be indicated.  
 The below list of examples of drug -drug interactions is not comprehensive and therefore the label of each d rug that is co -administered with darunavir should be consulted for information related to th e 10 route of metabolism, interaction pathways, potential risks, and specific actions to be taken with regards to co -administration.

α1-ADRENORECEPTOR ANTAGONIST  Alfuzosin  Based on theoretical considerations darunavir is expected to increase alfuzosin plasma concentrations.  (CYP3A  inhibition)  Co-administration of darunavir with low dose ritonavir and alfuzosin is contraindicated (see section 4.3).  13 INTERACTIONS AND DOSE RECOMMENDAT IONS WITH OTHER MEDICINAL PRODUCTS  Medicinal products by therapeutic areas  Interaction Geometric mean change (%) Recommendations concerning co - administration  ANAESTHETIC  Alfentanil  Not studied. The metabolism of alfentanil is mediated via CYP3A, and may as such be inhibited by darunavir co-administered with low dose ritonavir.  The concomitant use with darunavir and low dose ritonavir may require to lower the dose of alfentanil and requires monitoring  for risks of prolonged or delayed respiratory depression.  ANTIANGINA/ANTIARRHYTHMIC  Disopyramide  Flecainide  Lidocaine  (systemic)  Mexiletine  Propafenone  Not studied. Darunavir is expected to increase these antiarrhythmic plasma concentrations.  (CYP3A and/or CYP2D6 inhibition)  Caution is warranted and therapeut ic concentration monitoring, if available, is recommended for these antiarrhythmics when co -administered with darunavir with low dose ritonavir.  
 Amiodarone  Bepridil  Dronedarone  Ivabradine,  Quinidine  Ranolazine  Darunavir co -administered with low dose ritonavir and amiodarone, bepridil, dronedarone, ivabradine, quinidine, or ranolazine is contraindicated (see section 4.3).  Digoxin  
0.4 mg single dose  digoxin AUC ↑ 61%  digoxin C min ND  digoxin C max ↑ 29%  (↑ digoxin from probable inhibition of P-gp) Given that digoxin has a narrow therapeutic index, it is recommended that the lowest possible dose of digoxin should initially be prescribed in case digoxin is given to patients on darunavir/ritonavir therapy. The digoxin dose should be  carefully titrated to obtain the desired  clinical effect while assessing the overall clinical state of the subject.

14-OH-clarithromycin concentrations were not detectable when combined with darunavir/ritonavir.  (↑ clarithromycin from CYP3A inhibition and possible P -gp inhibition)  Caution should be exercised when clarithromycin is combined with darunavir co -administered with low dose ritonavir.  
 For patients with renal impairment the Summary of Product Characteristics for clarithromycin should be consulted for the recommended dose.  ANTICOAGULANT/PLA TELET AGGREGATION INHIBITOR  Apixaban  Rivaroxaban  Not studied. Co -administration of boosted darunavir with these anticoagulants may increase concentrations of the anticoagulant.  (CYP3A and/or P -gp inhibition).  The use of boosted darunavir  with a direct anticoagulant (DOAC) that is metabolized by CYP3A4 and transported by P -gp is not recommended  as this may lead to an increased bleeding risk.  14 INTERACTIONS AND DOSE RECOMMENDAT IONS WITH OTHER MEDICINAL PRODUCTS  Medicinal products by therapeutic areas  Interaction Geometric mean change (%) Recommendations concerning co - administration  Dabigatran   etexilate  Edoxaban

 Ticagrelor  Based on theoretical considerations, co-administration of boosted darunavir  with ticagrelor may increase concentrations of ticagrelor (CYP3A and/or P -glycoprotein inhibition).  
 Concomitant administration of boosted darunavir with ticagrelor is contraindicated (see section 4.3).  
 Clopidogrel  Not studied. Co-administration of clopidogrel with boosted darunavir is expected to decrease clopidogrel active metabolite plasma concentration, which may reduce the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel.  Co-administration of clopidogrel with boosted darunavir is not recommended.  
 Use of other antiplatelets not affected by CYP inhibition or induction (e.g. prasugrel) is recommended.  Warfarin  Not studied. Warfarin concentrations may be affected when co -administered with darunavir with low dose ritonavir.  It is recommended that the international normalised ratio (INR) be monitored when warfarin is combined with darunavir co -administered with low dose ritonavir.  ANTICONVULSANTS  Phenobarbital  Phenytoin  Not studied. Phenobarbital and phenytoin are expected to decrease plasma concentrations of darunavir and its pharmacoenhancer.

ANTIMYCOBACTERIALS  Rifampicin  Rifapentine  Not studied. Rifapentine and rifampicin are strong CYP3A inducers and have been shown to cause profound decreases in concentrations of other protease inhibitors, which can result in virological failure and resistance development (CYP450 enzyme induction). During attemp ts to overcome the decreased exposure by increasing the dose of other protease inhibitors with low dose ritonavir, a  high frequency of liver reactions was seen with rifampicin.  The combination of rifapentine and darunavir with concomitant low dose ritonavi r is not recommended.  
 The combination of rifampicin and darunavir with concomitant low dose ritonavir is contraindicated (see section 4.3).  17 INTERACTIONS AND DOSE RECOMMENDAT IONS WITH OTHER MEDICINAL PRODUCTS  Medicinal products by therapeutic areas  Interaction Geometric mean change (%) Recommendations concerning co - administration  Rifabutin

** sum of active moieties of rifabutin (parent drug + 25 -O-desacetyl metabolite)  
 The interaction trial showed a comparable daily systemic exposure for rifabutin between treatment at 300 mg on ce daily alone and 150 mg once every other day in combination with darunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) with an about 10 -fold increase in the daily exposure to the active metabolite 25 -O-desacetylrifabutin. Furthermore, AUC of the sum of active moieties of rifabutin (parent drug + 25 -O- desacetyl metabolite) was increased 
1.6-fold, while C max remained comparable.  Data on comparison with a 150 mg once daily reference dose is lacking.  
 (Rifabutin is an inducer and substrate of CYP3A.) An increase of systemic exposure to darunavir was observed when darunavir co -administered with 
100 mg ritonavir was co -administered with rifabutin (150 mg once every other day).  A dosage reduction of rifabutin by 
75% of the usual dose of 
300 mg/day (i.e. rifa butin 150 mg once every other day) and increased monitoring for rifabutin related adverse events is warranted in patients receiving the combination with darunavir co - administered with ritonavir. In case of safety issues, a further increase of the dosing i nterval for rifabutin and/or monitoring of rifabutin levels should be considered.  Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate treatment of tuberculosis in HIV infected patients.  Based upon the safety profile of darunavir/ritonavir , the increase in darunavir exposure in the presence of rifabutin does not warrant a dose adjustment for darunavir/ritonavir.  Based on pharmacokinetic modeling, this dosage reduction of 
75% is also applicable if patients receive rifabutin at doses other th an 
300 mg/day.  ANTINEOPLASTICS  Dasatinib  Nilotinib  Vinblastine  Vincristine  
 Not studied. Darunavir is expected to increase these antineoplastic plasma concentrations.  (CYP3A inhibition)  Concentrations of these medicinal products may be increased when co -administered with darunavir with low dose ritonavir resulting in the potential for increased adverse events usually associated with these agents.  Caution should be exercised when combining one of these antineoplastic agents with darunavir  with low dose ritonavir.  
 Everolimus  Irinotecan   Concomitant use of everolimus or Irinotecan and darunavir co -administered with low dose ritonavir is not recommended.  ANTIPSYCHOTICS/NEUROLEPTICS  Quetiapine  Not studied. Darunavir is expected to increase these antipsychotic plasma concentrations.  (CYP3A inhibition)  Concomitant administration of darunavir with low dose ritonavir and quetiapine is contraindicated as it may increase quetiapine - related toxicity. Increased  concentrations of quetiapine may lead to coma (see section 4.3).  18 INTERACTIONS AND DOSE RECOMMENDAT IONS WITH OTHER MEDICINAL PRODUCTS  Medicinal products by therapeutic areas  Interaction Geometric mean change (%) Recommendations concerning co - administration  Perphenazine  Risperidone  Thioridazine  Not studied. Darunavir is expected to increase these antipsychotic plasma concentrations.  (CYP3A, CYP2D6 and/or P -gp inhibition)  A dose decrease may be needed for these  drugs when co -administered with darunavir co -administered with low dose ritonavir.  Lurasidone Pimozide  Sertindole   Concomitant administration of darunavir with low dose ritonavir and lurasidone, pimozide or  sertindole is contraindicated (see section 4.3) . 
β-BLOCKERS  Carvedilol  Metoprolol  Timolol  Not studied. Darunavir is expected to increase these β -blocker plasma concentrations.  (CYP2D6 inhibition)  Clinical monitoring is recommended when co - administering darunavir with β -blockers. A lower dose of the β -blocker should be considered.  CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS  Amlodipine  Diltiazem  Felodipine  Nicardipine  Nifedipine  Verapamil  Not studied. Darunavir co -administered with low dose ritonavir can be expected to increase the plasma concentrations of calcium channel blockers.  (CYP3A and/or CYP2D6 inhibition)  Clinical monitoring of therapeutic and adverse effects is recommended when these medicines are concomitantly  administered with darunavir with low dose ritonavir.  CORTICOSTEROIDS  Corticosteroids primarily metabolised by CYP3A (including betamethasone, budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone, prednisone, triamcinolone)  Fluticasone: in a clinical study where ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily were co -administered with 50 μg intranasal fluticasone propionate  (4 times daily) for 7 days in healthy subjects, fluticasone propionate plasma concentrations increased significantly, whereas the intrinsic cortisol levels decreased by approximately 86% (90% CI 82 -89%). Greater effects ma y be expected when fluticasone is inhaled. Systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression have been reported in patients receiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasally administered fluticasone. The effects of high fluticasone systemic exposure on ritonavir plasma levels are unknown.  
 Other corticosteroids: interaction not studied. Plasma concentrations of these medicinal products may be increased when co -administered with darunavir with low dose ritonavir, resulting in  reduced serum cortisol concentrations.  Concomitant use of darunavir with low dose ritonavir and corticosteroids (all routes of administration) that are metabolised by CYP3A may increase the risk of development of systemic corticosteroid effects, including  Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression.  
 Co-administration with CYP3A - metabolised corticosteroids is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk, in which case patients should be monitored for systemic corticosteroi d effects.  
 Alternative corticosteroids which are less dependent on CYP3A metabolism e.g. beclomethasone should be considered, particularly for long term use.  Dexamethasone (systemic)  Not studied. Dexamethasone may decrease plasma concentrations of daruna vir. (CYP3A induction)  Systemic dexamethasone should be used with caution when combined  with darunavir  co-administered  with low dose ritonavir.  19 INTERACTIONS AND DOSE RECOMMENDAT IONS WITH OTHER MEDICINAL PRODUCTS  Medicinal products by therapeutic areas  Interaction Geometric mean change (%) Recommendations concerning co - administration  ENDOTHELIN RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS  Bosentan  Not studied. Concomitant use of bosentan and darunavir co - administered with low dose ritonavir may increase plasma concentrations of bosentan.  Bosentan is expected to decrease plasma concentrations of darunavir  and/or its pharmacoenhancer. (CYP3A induction)  When administered concomitantly with darunavir and low dose ritonavir, the patient’s tolerability of bosentan should be monitored.  HEPATITIS C VIRUS (HCV) DIRECT -ACTING ANTIVIRALS  NS3-4A protease inhibitors  Elbasvir/grazoprevir  Darunavir with low dose ritonavir may increase the exposure to grazoprevir. (CYP3A and OATP1B inhibition).  Concomitant use of darunavir with low dose ritonavir and  elbasvir/grazoprevir is contraindicated (see section 4.3).  Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir  Based on theoretical considerations boosted darunavir may increase the  exposure to glecaprevir and pibrentasvir.

25 mg sildenafil co -administered with darunavir and low dose ritonavir.  The combination of avanafil and darunavir with low dose ritonavir is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Concomitant use of othe r PDE -5 inhibitors for the treatment of erectile dysfunction with darunavir co-administered with low dose ritonavir should be done with caution. If concomitant use of darunavir co -administered with low dose ritonavir with sildenafil, vardenafil or tadalafi l is indicated, sildenafil at a single dose not exceeding 25 mg in 48 hours, vardenafil at a single dose not exceeding 2.5 mg in 72 hours or tadalafil at a single dose not  exceeding 10 mg in 72 hours is recommended.  22 INTERACTIONS AND DOSE RECOMMENDAT IONS WITH OTHER MEDICINAL PRODUCTS  Medicinal products by therapeutic areas  Interaction Geometric mean change (%) Recommendations concerning co - administration  For the treatment of pulmonary arterial  hypertension  Sildenafil  Tadalafil  Not studied. Concomitant use of sildenafil or tadalafil for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension and darunavir co -administered with low dose ritonavir may increase plasma concentrations of sildenafil or tadalafil. (CYP3A inhibition)  A safe and effective dose of sildenafil for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension co -administered with darunavir and low dose ritonavir has not been established. There is an increased potential for sil denafil - associated adverse events (including visual disturbances, hypotension, prolonged erection and syncope). Therefore, co - administration of darunavir with low dose ritonavir and sildenafil when used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertensio n is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Co -administration of tadalafil for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension with darunavir and low dose ritonavir is not  recommended.  PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS  Omeprazole
