 Immunisations  
 In a randomised, open label study of 60 patients with relapsing MS there was no significant difference in the humoral immune response to a recall antigen (tetanus toxoid) and only slightly slower and reduced  humoral immune response to a neoantigen (keyhole limpet haemocyanin) was observed in  patients who were treated with this medicinal product for 6 months compared to an untreated control group. Live vaccines have not been studied.
