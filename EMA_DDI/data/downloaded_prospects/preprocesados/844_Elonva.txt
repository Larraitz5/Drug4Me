4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No interaction studies with Elonva and other medicines have been performed. Since corifollitropin alfa is not a substrate of cytochrome P450 enzymes, no metabolic interactions with other medicinal products are anticipated.  
 Elonva may cause a false positive h CG pregnancy test if the test is administered during the ovarian stimulation portion of the ART cycle. This may be due to cross -reactivity of h 
 CG pregnancy tests with the carboxy -terminal peptide of the beta subunit of Elonva.
