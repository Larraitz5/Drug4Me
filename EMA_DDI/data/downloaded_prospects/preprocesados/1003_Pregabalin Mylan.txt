4.5  Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 Since pregabalin is predominantly excreted unchanged in the  urine, undergoes negligible metabolism in humans (<2% of a dose recovered in urine as metabolit es), does not inhibit drug metabolism in vitro , and is not bound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely to produce, or be subject to, pharmacokinetic interactions. 
 In vivo  studies and population pharmacokinetic analysis 
 Accordingly, in in vivo studies no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between pregabalin and phenytoin, carbamazepine, valpro ic acid, lamotrigine, gabapentin, lorazepam, oxycodone or ethanol. Population pharmacokinetic analysi s indicated that oral antidiabetics, diuretics, insulin, phenobarbital, tiagabine and topiramate had no clinical ly significant effect on pregabalin clearance. 
 Oral contraceptives, norethisterone and/or ethinyl oestradiol  
 Co-administration of pregabalin with the oral contraceptive s norethisterone and/or ethinyl oestradiol does not influence the steady-state pharmacokinetics of  either substance. 
 Central nervous system influencing medical products 
 Pregabalin may potentiate the effects of ethanol and loraze pam.  
 In the postmarketing experience, there are reports of re spiratory failure, coma and deaths in patients taking pregabalin and opioids and/or other central nervo us system (CNS) depressant medicinal products. Pregabalin appears to be additive in the impairm ent of cognitive and gross motor function caused by oxycodone. 
 Interactions and the elderly 
 No specific pharmacodynamic interaction studies were c onducted in elderly volunteers. Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.
