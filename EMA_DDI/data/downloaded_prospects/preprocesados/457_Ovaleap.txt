4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Concomitant use of follitropin alfa with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation (e.g. h 
 CG, clomifene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a Gn 
 RH agonist or antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of follitropin alfa needed to elicit an adequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant medicinal product interaction has been reported during follitropin alfa therapy.
