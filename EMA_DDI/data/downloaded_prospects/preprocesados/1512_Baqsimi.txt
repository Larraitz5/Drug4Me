 Insulin Reacts antagonistically towards glucagon  
 
 
 
 4 Indometacin  
 When used with indometacin, glucagon may lose its ability to raise blood glucose or may even produce hypoglycaemia.  
 Beta-blockers 
 Patients taking beta -blockers might be expected to have a greater increase in both pulse and blood pressure, an increase of which will be transient because of glucagon's short half -life. 
 Glucagon treatment results in catecholamine release from the adrenal glands, and concomitant use of beta-blockers could result in unopposed alpha -adrenergic stimulation and consequently, a greater increase in blood pressure (see section  4.4). 
 Warfarin 
 Glucagon may increase the anticoagulant effect of warfarin.
