4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No interaction studies have been performed, as no interactions are expected via cytochrome P450 enzymes, other metabolising enzymes or transporters.   
 Vaccinations  
 The safety of immunisation with live or live -attenuated vaccines, following ocrelizumab  therapy has not been studied.  
 Data are available on the effects of tetanus toxoid, 23- valent pneumococcal polysaccharide, keyhole limpet hemocyanin neoantigen, and seasonal influenza vaccines  in patients receiving  ocrelizumab  (see section  4.4 and 5.1 ).  
 After treatment over 2  years, the proportion of patients with positive antibody titers against  S. pneumoniae , mumps, rubella and varicella were generally similar to the proportions at baseline.  
 Immunosuppressants  
 It is not recommended to use other immunosuppressive  therapies concomitantly with ocrelizumab  except corticosteroids for symptomatic treatment of relapses (see section  4.4).
