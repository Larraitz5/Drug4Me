4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No interaction studies have been performed.  
 The effect of alternate -day administration of 250 microgram (8.0 million IU) of Betaferon on drug metabolism in multi ple sclerosis patients is unknown. Corticosteroid or ACTH treatment of relapses for periods of up to 28 days has been well tolerated in patients receiving Betaferon.  
 Due to the lack of clinical experience in multiple sclerosis patients, the use of Betafer on together with immunomodulators other than corticosteroids or ACTH is not recommended.  
 Interferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450 -dependent enzymes in humans and animals. Caution should be exercised when Betaferon i s administered in combination with medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic cytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. anti -epileptics. Additional caution should be exercised with any co -medication wh ich has an effect on the haematopoietic  system.  
 No interaction studies with anti -epileptics have been carried out.
