4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Alendronate If taken at the same time, it is likely that food and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids, and some oral medicinal products will interfere with absorption of alendronate. Therefore, patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate before taking any other oral medicinal product (see sections  4.2 and 5.2).  
 Since Non Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) use is associated with gastrointestinal irritation, caution should be used during concomitant use with alendronate. 
 Colecalciferol  Olestra, mineral oils, orlistat, and bile acid sequestrants (e.g. cholestyramine, colestipol) may impair the absorption of vitamin D. Anticonvulsants, cimetidine and thiazides may increase the catabolism of vitamin  D. Additional vitamin  D supplements may b e considered on an individual basis.
