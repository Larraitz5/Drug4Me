4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Trizivir contains abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine, therefore any interactions identified for these individually are relevant to Trizivir. Clinical studies have shown that there are no clinically significant interactions between abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine.  
 Abacavir is metabolised by UDP -glucuronyltransferase (UGT) enzymes and alcohol dehydrogenase; co-administration of inducers or inhibitors of UGT enzymes or with compounds eliminated through alcohol dehydrogenase could alter abacavir exposure. Zidovudine is primarily metabolised by UGT enzymes; co -administration of inducers or inhibitors of UGT enzymes could alter zidovudine exposure. Lamivudine is cleared renally. Active renal secretion of lamivudine in the urine is mediated through organic cation transporte rs (OCTs); co -administration of lamivudine with OCT inhibitors may increase lamivudine exposure.  
 Abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine are not significantly metabolised by cytochrome P
450 enzymes (such as CYP 3A4, CYP 2C9 or CYP 2D6) nor do they induce this enzyme system. Lamivudine  and zidovudine  do not inhibit cytochrome P 450 enzymes. Abacavir shows limited potential to inhibit metabolism mediated by CYP3A4 and has been shown in vitro not to inhibit CYP2C 9 or CYP 2D6 enzymes. In vitro studies have shown that abacavir has potential to inhibit cytochrome P 450 1A1 (CYP1A1).  Therefore, there is little potential for interactions with antiretroviral protease inhibitors, non-nucleosides and other medicinal produc ts metabolised by major P 450 enzymes.  
 Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. The list below should not be considered exhaustive but is representative of the classes studied.

 In vitro  lamivudine inhibits the intracellular phosphorylation of cladribine leading to a potential risk of cladribine loss of efficacy in case of combination in the clinical setting. Some clinical findings also support a possible interaction between lamivudine and cladribine.  Therefore, t he concomitant use of lamivud ine with cladribine is  not recommended (see section 4.4).

 Exacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen used to treat HIV although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. The concomitant use of ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4). Consideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combinati on ART regimen if this is already established. This would be particularly important in patients with a known history of zidovudine induced anaemia. 
 Concomitant treatment, especially acute therapy, with potentially nephrotoxic or myelosuppressive medicinal products (e.g. systemic pentamidine, dapsone, pyrimethamine, co- trimoxazole, amphotericin, flucytosine, ganciclovir, interferon, vincristine, vinblastine and doxorubicin) may also increase the risk of adverse reactions to zidovudine (see section 4.8). If concomitant therapy with Trizivir and any of these medicinal products is necessary then extra care should be taken in monitoring renal function and haematological parameters and, if required, the dosage of one or more agents should be reduced.  
 Limited dat a from clinical trials do not indicate a significantly increased risk of adverse reactions to zidovudine with cotrimoxazole (see interaction information above relating to lamivudine and co-trimoxazole), aerosolised pentamidine, pyrimethamine and acyclovir at doses used in prophylaxis.
