4.5 ). If switching the pharmacoenhancer from ritonavir to cobicistat, caution is required during the first two weeks of treatment with darunavir/cobicistat, particularly if doses of any concomitantly administered medicinal products have been titrated or adjus ted during use of ritonavir as a pharmacoenhancer. A dose reduction of the co -administered drug may be needed in these cases.Efavirenz in combination with boosted PREZISTA may result in sub -optimal darunavir C min. If efavirenz is to be used in combinatio n with PREZISTA, the PREZISTA/ ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily regimen should be used. See the Summary of Product Characteristics for PREZISTA 75 mg, 
150mg and600mg tablets (see section 4.5).Life-threatening and fatal drug interactions have been repor ted in patients treated with colchicine and strong inhibitors of CYP3A and P-glycoprotein ( P-gp;see section s 4.3 and 4.5).PREZISTA oral suspension contains sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E219) which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed).PREZISTA oral suspension contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per ml, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium -free’.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 The interaction profile of darunavir may differ depending on whether ritonavir or cobicistat is used as pharmacoenhancer. The recommendations given for concomitant use of darunavir and other medicinal products may therefore differ depending on whether darunavir is boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat (see section s4.3 and 4.4), and caution is also required during the first time of treatment if switching the pharmacoenhancer from ritonavir to cobicistat (see section 4.4).Medicinal products that affect darunavir exposure (ritonavir as pharmacoenhancer)Darunavir and ritonavir are metabolised by CYP3A. Medicinal products that induce CYP3A activity would be expected to increase the clearance of darunavir and ritonavir, resulting in lowered plasma 10concentrations of these compounds and consequently that of darunavir, lead ing to loss of therapeutic effect and possible development of resistance (see section s4.3 and 4.4). CYP3A inducers that a re contraindicated include rifampicin, St John’s Wort and lopinavir.Co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir with other medicina l products that inhibit CYP3A may decrease the clearance of darunavir and ritonavir, which may result in increased plasma concentrations of darunavir and ritonavir. Co -administration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is not recommended and caution is warranted , these interactions are described in the interaction table below ( e.g.indinavir, azole antifungals such as clotrimazole).Medicinal products that affect darunavir exposure (cobicistat as pharmacoenhancer)Darunavir and cobicistat are metabolised by CYP3 A, and co -administration with CYP3A inducers may therefore result in subtherapeutic plasma exposure to darunavir. Darunavir boosted with cobicistat is more sensitive to CYP3A induction than ritonavir -boosted darunavir: co -administration of darunavir/cobici stat with medicinal products that are strong inducers of CYP3A ( e.g.St 
 John’s Wort, rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin) is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Co-administration of darunavir/cobicistat with weak to moderate CYP3A induce rs (e.g.efavirenz, etravirine, nevirapine ,fluticasone, and bosentan) is not recommended (see interaction table below).For co -administration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, the same recommendations apply independent of whether darunavir is boosted with r itonavir or with cobicistat (see section above).Medicinal products that may be affected by darunavir boosted with ritonavir 
 Darunavir and ritonavir are inhibitors of CYP3A , CYP2D6 and P -gp. Co-administration of darunavir /ritonavir with medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP3A and/or CYP2D6 or transported by P -gpmay result in increased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions.Co-administration of boosted darunav ir with drugs that have active metabolite(s) formed by CYP3A may result in reduced plasma concentrations of these active metabolite(s), potentially leading to loss of their therapeutic effect (see the Interaction table below).Darunavir co-administered wi th low dose ritonavir must not be combined with medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which increased systemic exposure is associated with serious and/or life -threatening eve nts (narrow therapeutic index) (see section 4.3).The overall pharmacokinetic enhancement effect by ritonavir was an approximate 14 -fold increase in the systemic exposure of darunavir when a single dose of 600 mg darunavir was given orally in combination with ritonavir at 100 mg twice daily. Theref ore, darunavir must only be used in combination with a pharmacokinetic enhancer (see section s 4.4 and 5.2).A clinical study utilising a cocktail of medicinal products that are metabolised by cytochromes CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 demonstrated an increase in CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 activity and inhibition of CYP2D6 activity in the presence of darunavir /ritonavir , which may be attributed to the presence of low dose ritonavir. Co -administration of darunavir and ritonavir with medicinal products which are primaril y metabolised by CYP2D6 ( such as flecainide, propafenone, metoprolol) may result in increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products, which could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions. Co -administration of darunavir and ritonavir with medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP2C9 ( such as warfarin) and CYP2C19 ( such as methadone) may result in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could decrease or shorten their therapeutic effect.Althou gh the effect on CYP2C8 has only been studied in vitro , co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir and medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP2C8 ( such as paclitaxel, rosiglitazone,repaglinide) may result in decreased systemic exposure to such m edicinal products, which could decrease or shorten their therapeutic effect.11Ritonavir inhibits the transporters P -glycoprotein, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, and co -administration with substrates of these transporters can result in increased plasma concentrations of these compounds (e.g.dabigatran etexilate, digoxin, statins and bosentan; see the Interaction table below).Medicinal products that may be affected by darunavir boosted with cobicistat 
 The recommendations for darunavir boosted with ritonavir are similar to the recommendations for darunavir boosted with cobicistat with regard to substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, P -glycoprotein, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 (see contraindications and recommendations presented in the section above). Cobicistat 150 mg given with darun avir 800 mg once daily enhances darunavir pharmacokinetic parameters in a comparable way to ritonavir (see section 5.2).Unlike ritonavir, cobicistat does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or UGT1A1. For further information on cobicistat, consult the cobicistat Summary of Product Characteristics.Interaction table 
 Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.Several of the interaction studies (indicated by #in the table below) have been performed at lower than recommended dos es of darunavir or with a different dosing regimen (see section 4.2 Posology). The effects on co -administered medicinal products may thus be underestimated and clinical monitoring of safety may be indicated.The interaction profile of darunavir depends on whether ritonavir or cobicistat is used as pharmacokinetic enhancer. Darunavir may therefore have different recommendations for concomitant medications depending on whether the compound is boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat. The same recommendations app ly, unless specifically indicated. For further information on cobicistat, consult the cobicistat Summary of Product Characteristics.Interactions between darunavir/ritonavir and antiretroviral and non -antiretroviral medicinal products are listed in the ta ble below. The direction of the arrow for each pharmacokinetic parameter is based on the 90% confidence interval of the geometric mean ratio being within ( ↔), below (↓) or above (↑) the 80 -125% range (not determined as “ND”) .In the table below the specif ic pha rmacokinetic enhancer is specified when recommendations differ. When the recommendation is the same for PREZISTA when co -administered with a low dose ritonavir or cobi cistat, the term “boosted PREZISTA” is used.The below list of examples of drug -drug interactions is not comprehensive and therefore the label of each drug that is co -administered with PREZISTA should be consulted for information related to the route of metabolism, interaction pathways, potential risks, and specific actions to be taken with regards to co -administration.INTERACTIONS AND DOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WITH OTHER MEDICINAL PRODUCTSMedicinal product examples by therapeutic area

 Not studied. Rifapentine and rifampicin are strong CYP3A inducers and have been shown to cause profound decreasesin concentrations of other protease inhibitors, which can result in virological failure and resistance development (CYP450 enzyme induction). During attempts to overcome the decreased exposure by increasing the dose of other protease inhibitors with low d ose ritonavir, a high frequency of liver reactions was seen with rifampicin.The combination of rifapentine and boosted PREZISTA is not recommended.The combination of rifampicin and boosted PREZISTA is contraindicated (see section 4.3).Rifabutin

**sum of active moieties of rifabutin (parent drug + 25-O-desacetyl metabolite)The interaction trial showed a comparable daily systemic exposur e for rifabutin between treatment at 300 mg once daily alone and 150 mg o nce every other day in combination with PREZISTA/ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) with an about 10 -fold increase in the daily exposure to the active metabolite 25 -O-desacetylrifabut in. Furthermore, AUC of the sum of active moieties of rifabutin (parent drug 
+25-O-desacetyl metabolite) was increased 1.6 -fold, while C maxremained comparable.Data on comparison with a 150 mg once daily reference dose is lacking.(Rifabutin is an induc er and substrate of CYP3A.) An increase of systemic exposure to darunavir was observed when PREZISTA co -administered with 100 mg ritonavir was co -administered with rifabutin (150 mg once every other day).A dosage reduction of rifabutin by 
75% of the usual dose of 
300mg/day (i.e. rifabutin 150 mg once every other day) and increased monitoring for rifabutin related adverse events is warranted in patients receiving the combination with PREZISTA co-administered with ritonavir . In case of safety issues, a furt her increase of the dosing interval for rifabutin and/or monitoring of rifabutin levels should be considered.Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate treatment of tuberculosis in HIV infected patients.Based upon the safety pr ofile of PREZISTA/ritonavir, the increase in darunavir exposure in the presence of rifabutin does not warrant a dose adjustment for PREZISTA/ritonavir.Based on pharmacokinetic modeling, this dosage reduction of 
75% is also applicable if patients receive r ifabutin at doses other than 300 mg/day.Co-administration of PREZISTA co-administered with cobicistat andrifabutin is not recommended.ANTINEOPLASTICSDasatinib
