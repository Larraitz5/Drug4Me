4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction   
 No data on concomitant administration o f Ambirix with specific hepatitis A immunoglobulin or hepatitis B immunoglobulin have been generated. However, when the monovalent hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines were administered concomitantly with specific immunoglobulins there was no effect on ser oconversion rates. Concomitant immunoglobulin administration may result in lower antibody titres.  
 When Ambirix was administered concomitantly with, but as a separate injection to a combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, inactivated poliomyelit is and Haemophilus influenzae  type b 5 vaccine (DTPa -IPV+Hib) or with a combined Measles -Mumps -Rubella vaccine in the second year of life, immune responses to all antigens were satisfactory (see section 5.1) . 
 Concomitant administration of Ambirix and other vaccines than those listed above has not been studied. It is advised that Ambirix should not be administered at the same time as other vaccines unless absolutely necessary.  Concomitant vaccines should always  be administered at separate injection sites and preferably into different limbs.  
 It may be expected that in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment or patients with immunodeficiency, an adequate response may not be achieved.
