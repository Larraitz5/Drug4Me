4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No interacti on studies have been performed with Buvidal . 
 8 Buprenorphine  should be used cautiously when co- administered with:  
• naltrexone and nalmefene: These are opioid antagonists that can block the pharmacological effects of buprenorphine. For opioid- dependent patients currently receiving buprenorphine treatment, naltrexone may precipitate a sudden onset of prolonged and intense opioid withdrawal symptoms. For patients currently receiving naltrexone treatment, the intended therapeutic effects of buprenorphine administration may be blocked by naltrexone.  
• alcoholic drinks or medicinal products containing alcohol as alcohol increases the sedative effect of buprenorphine (see section 4.7).  
• benzodiazepines: This combination may result in death due to respiratory depression of central origin . Therefo re, dosages  must be closely monitored and this combination must be avoided in cases where there is a risk of misuse. Patients should be warned that it is extremely dangerous to self-administer non -prescribed benzodiazepines whilst taking this product, and should also be cautioned to use benzodiazepines concurrently with this product only as directed by their physician
 (see section  4.4).  
• gabapent inoids: This combination may result in death due to respiratory depression. Therefore, dosages  must be closely monitored a nd this combination must be avoided in cases where there is a risk of misuse. Patients should be cautioned to  use gabapent inoids (such as pregabalin and gabapentin)  concurrently with this product  only as directed by their physician (see section 4.4).  
• Serotonergic medicinal products, such as MAO inhibitors, selective serotonin re -uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), seroto nin norepinephrine re -uptake inhibitors (SNRIs) or tricyclic antidepressants as the risk of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life- threatening condition, is increased (see section  4.4).  
• other central nervous system depressants: Other opioid derivatives (e.g. methadone, analgesics and antitussives); certain antidepressants, sedative H
1-receptor antagonists, barbiturates, anxiolytics other than benzodiazepines, antipsychotics , clonidine and related substances. These combinations increase centra l nervous system depression. The reduced level of alertness can make driving and using machinery hazardous  (see section  4.7). 
• opioid analgesics: Adequate analgesia may be difficult to achieve when administering a full opioid agonist in patients receiving b uprenorphine. The potential for overdose also exists with a full agonist, especially when attempting to overcome buprenorphine partial agonist effects, or when buprenorphine plasma levels are declining (see section  4.4) 
• Buprenorphine is metabolised to norbuprenorphine primarily by CYP3A4. Interaction with co -administered inducers or inhibitors have been established in studies using transmucosal and transdermal buprenorphine. Buprenorphine is also metabolised to buprenorphine -3β-glucuronide by UGT1A1. • CYP3A4  inhibitors may inhibit the metabolism of buprenorphine resulting in increased Cmax and AUC of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine . Buvidal  avoids first -pass effects and CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. protease inhibitors like ritonavir, nelfinavir or indinavir, or  azole antifungals such as ketoconazole or itraconazole, or macrolide antibiotics) are expected to have less effects on buprenorphine metabolism when co- administered with Buvidal  as compared to when co -administered with sublingual buprenorphine. When switc hing from sublingual buprenorphine to Buvidal , patients may need to be monitored to ensure plasma buprenorphine levels are adequate.  Patients already on Buvidal who start treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors should be treated with weekly Buvidal and be monito red for signs and symptoms of overtreatment. Conversely, if a patient who is concomitantly treated with Buvidal and a CYP3A4 inhibitor stops treatment with the CYP3A4 inhibitor, the patient should be monitored for symptoms of withdrawal (see section  4.4).  
• CYP3A4 inducers may induce the metabolism of buprenorphine resulting in decreased buprenorphine levels. Buvidal  avoids first -pass effects and CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin or rifampicin) are expected to have less effects on buprenorphine metabolism when co- administered with Buvidal  as compared to when co-administered with sublingual buprenorphine. When switching from sublingual buprenorphine to Buvidal , patients may need to be monitored to ensure plasma buprenorphine levels are adequate. Patients already on Buvidal who start treatment with CYP3A4 inducers should be treated with weekly Buvidal and be monitored for signs and 9 symptoms of withdrawal. Conver sely, if a patient who is concomitantly treated with Buvidal and a CYP3A4 inducer stops treatment with the CYP3A4 inducer, the patient should be monitored for symptoms of overtreatment.  
• UGT1A1 inhibitors may affect the systemic exposure of buprenorphine.  
• monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI): Possible exacerbation of the opioids  effects, based on experience with morphine.
