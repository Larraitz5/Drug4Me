4.5 Interaction with  other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Co-administration of aclidinium bromide with other anticholinergic -containing medicinal produ cts has not been studied and is not recommended.  
 Although no formal in vivo drug interaction studies hav e been performed , inhaled aclidinium bromide has been used concomitantly with other COPD medicinal prod ucts including sympathomimetic bronchodilators, methylxanthines, and oral and inhaled steroids without clinical evidence of drug interactions.  4  In vitro  studies have shown that aclidinium bromide or the metabolites of aclidinium bromide at the therapeutic dose are not expected to cause interactions with  active substances that are substrates of P-glycoprotein (P -gp), or active substances  metabolised by cyto chrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes  and esterases (see section 5.2).
