4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No interaction studies have been performed. The cl inical studies indicate that multiple sclerosis patients can receive peginterferon beta-1a and corticosteroids during relapses. Interferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450- dependent enzymes in humans and animals. Cautio n should be exercised when peginterferon beta -1a  is administered in combination with medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic cytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. some classes of antiepileptics and antidepressants.
