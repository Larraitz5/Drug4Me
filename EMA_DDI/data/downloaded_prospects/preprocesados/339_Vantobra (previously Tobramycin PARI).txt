4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No interaction studies have been performed.  Based  on the interaction profile for tobramycin following intravenous and aerosolised administration, concurrent and/or sequential use of Vantobra  is not recommended with other medicinal products with nephrotoxic or ototoxic potential, such as:  
- amphotericin B , cefalotin, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, polymyxins (risk of increased nephrotoxicity);  
- platinum compounds (risk of increased nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity);   
 Concurrent use of Vantobra  with diuretic compounds (such as ethacrynic acid, furosemide, urea o r mannitol) is not recommended. Such compounds can enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering antibiotic concentrations in serum and tissue (see section 4.4).  
 Other medicinal products that have been reported to increase the potential toxicity of parenter ally administered aminoglycosides include:  
- anticholinesterases, botulinum toxin (neuromuscular effects).  
 In clinical studies patients using inhaled tobramycin continued to take dornase alfa, bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids  and macrolides. No evidence of drug interactions with these medicines was identified.
