4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other fo rms of interaction  
 There is potential for exacerbation of skin photosensitivity if temoporfin is used with other photosensitising active substances. Such a reaction has been reported with topical  5-fluorouracil.  
 No other interactions have been observed. An in vitro  study with human liver tissue has shown no potential for drug interaction through inhibition of cytochrome P -450 enzymes by temoporfin.
