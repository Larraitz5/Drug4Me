4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No interaction studies have been performed.  
 Theoretically, the effect of botulinum toxin may be potentiated by aminoglycoside antibiotics, spectinomycin, or other medicinal products that interfere with neuromuscular transmission (e.g. neuromuscular blocking medicinal products ). 
 The effect of administering different botulinum neurotoxin serotypes at the same time or within several months of each other is unknown. Excessive neuromuscular weakness may be exacerbated by administration of another botulinum toxin prior to the resolutio n of the effects of a previously administered botulinum toxin.
