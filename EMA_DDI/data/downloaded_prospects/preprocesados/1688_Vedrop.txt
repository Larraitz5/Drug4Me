 Due to inhibition of P-Glycoprotein transporter, tocofersolan may also enhance intestinal absorption of other concomitant fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) or that of highly lipophilic medicinal products (such as steroids, antibiotics, antihistamines, cyclosporine, tacrolimus). Therefore, monitoring should be performed and, when necessary, doses should be adjusted.
