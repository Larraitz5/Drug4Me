4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Limited data suggest that co -admin istration of miglustat  and enzyme replacement with imiglucerase in patients with type 1  Gaucher disease may result in decreased exposure to miglustat (approximate reductions of 22% in Cmax and 14% in AUC were observed in a small parallel -group study). This  study also indicated that miglustat  has no or limited effect on the pharmacokinetics of imiglucerase.
