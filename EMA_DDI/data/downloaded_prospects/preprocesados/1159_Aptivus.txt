4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 The interaction profile of Aptivus , co-administered with low dose ritonavir, is complex and requires special attention in particular in combination with other antiretroviral agents.Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.Metabolic profile of tipranavir 
 Tipranavir is a substrate, an inducer and an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 CYP3A. When co -administered with ritonavir at the recommended dosage (see section 4.2) there is a net inhibition of P450 CYP3A. Co -administration of Aptivus and low dose ritonavir with agents primarily metabolised by CYP3A may result in changed plasma concentrations of tipranavir or the other agents, which could alter their therapeutic and undesirable effects (see list and details of considered agents, below). Agents that are contraindicated specifically due to the expected magnitude of interaction and potential for serious adverse reactions are detailed in this section, and listed in section 4.3.A cocktail study was conducted in 16 healthy volunteers with twice -daily 500mgtipranavir with 
200mg ritonavir capsule adminis tration for 10 days to assess the net effect on the activity of hepatic CYP 1A2 (caffeine), 2C9 (warfarin), 2D6 (dextromethorphan), both intestinal/hepatic CYP 3A4 (midazolam) and P -glycoprotein ( P-gp) (digoxin). At steady state, there was a significant in duction of CYP 1A2 and a slight induction on CYP 2C9. Potent inhibition of CYP 2D6 and both hepatic and intestinal CYP 3A4 activities were observed. P-gpactivity is significantly inhibited after the first dose, but there was a slight induction at steady s tate. Practical recommendations deriving from this study are displayed below.Studies in human liver microsomes indicated tipranavir is an inhibitor of CYP 1A2, CYP 2C9, CYP 
2C19 and CYP 2D6. The potential net effect of tipranavir with ritonavir on CYP 2 D6 is inhibition, because ritonavir is also a CYP 2D6 inhibitor. The in vivo net effect of tipranavir with ritonavir on CYP 1A2, CYP 2C9 and CYP 2C19, indicates, through a preliminary study, an inducing potential of tipranavir with ritonavir on CYP1A2 and, to a lesser extent, on CYP2C9 and P -gp after several days of treatment. Data are not available to indicate whether tipranavir inhibits or induces glucuronosyl transferases. In vitro studies show that tipranavir is a substrate and also an inhibitor of P-gp. 9It is difficult to predict the net effect of Aptivus co-administered with low dose ritonavir on oral bioavailability and plasma concentrations of agents that are dual substrates of CYP3A and P-gp. The net effect will vary depending on the relative affinity of the co -administered substance for CYP3A and P-gp, and the extent of intestinal first -pass metabolism/efflux.Co-administration of Aptivus and agents that induce CYP3A and/or P-gpmay decrease tipranavir concentrations and reduce its therapeuti c effect (see list and details of considered agents, below). Co -administration of Aptivus and medicinal products that inhibit P-gpmay increase tipranavir plasma concentrations.Known and theoretical interactions with selected antiretrovirals and non -antiretroviral medicinal products are listed in the table below.Interaction table 
 Interactions between Aptivus and co -administered medicinal products are listed in the table below (increase is indicated as “ ↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”, once daily a s “QD”, twice daily as 
“BID” , concentration at end of dosing interval as “ Cτ”).Unless otherwise stated, studies detailed below have been performed with the recommended dosage of Aptivus /r (i.e. 500/200 mg BID). However, some PK interaction studies were not performed with this recommended dosage. Nevertheless, the results of many of these interaction studies can be extrapolated to the recommended dosage since the doses used (eg. TPV/r 500/100 mg, TPV/r 
750/200 mg) represented extremes of hepatic enzyme in duction and inhibition and bracketed the recommended dosage of Aptivus /r.Drugs by therapeutic area Interaction

 No interaction study performed 
 The limited data available from a phase IIa study in HIV -infected patients suggest that no significant interaction is expected between nevirapine and TPV/r. Moreover a study with TPV/r and another NNRTI (efavirenz) did not show any clinically relevant interaction (see above).No dosage adjustment necessary.Rilpivirine 
 No interaction study performed 
 Concomitant use of rilpivirine with some ritonavir -boosted protease inhibitors has demonstrated an increase in the plasma concentrations of rilpivirine.Close monitoring for signs of rilpivirine toxicit y and possibly also dose adjust ment of rilpivirine is recommended when co -administered with Aptivus/ritonavir.Protease inhibitors (PIs)According to current treatment guidelines, dual therapy with protease inhibitors is generally not recommended

 No data are currently available on interactions of tipranavir, co -administered with low dose ritonavir, with protease inhibitors other than those listed above.Combination with Aptivus, co -administe red with low dose ritonavir, is not recommended (see section 4.4)12Fusion inhibitors 
 Enfuvirtide No interaction study performed 
 In studies where tipranavir co -administered with low -dose ritonavir was used with or without enfuvirtide, it has been observedthat the steady -state plasma tipranavir trough concentration of patients receiving enfuvirtide were 
45% higher as compared to patients not receiving enfuvirtide. No information is available for the parameters AUC and C max. A pharmacokinetic interaction i s mechanistically unexpected and the interaction has not been confirmed in a controlled interaction study.The clinical impact of the observed data, especially regarding the tipranavir with ritonavir safety profile, remains unknown. Nevertheless, the clini cal data available from the RESIST trials did not suggest any significant alteration of the tipranavir with ritonavir safety profile when combined with enfuvirtide as compared to patients treated with tipranavir with ritonavir without enfuvirtide.Integrase strand transfer inhibitors 
 Raltegravir 400 mg BID Raltegravir C max↔Raltegravir AUC 0 -12↔Raltegravir C12: ↓ 45%Despite an almost half reduction of C12, previous clinical studies with this combination did not evidence an impaired outcome. The mechanism of action is thought to be induction of glucuronosyltransferase by tipranavir/r.No particular dose adjustment is recommended when 
 Aptivus/ritonavir is administeredwith Raltegravir 400 mg BID.For other doses of raltegravir,please refer to the relevant productinformation for raltegravir. .Dolutegravir 50 mg QD Dolutegravir ↓AUC ↓59%Cmax ↓47%Cτ ↓76%(induction of UGT1A1 and

 Ketoconazole 
 No interaction study performed 
 Based on theoretical considerations tipranavir, co -administered with low dose ritonavir, is expected to increase itraconazole or ketoconazole concentrations.Itraconazole or ketoconazole should be used with caution (doses 
200mg/day are not recommended).13Based on theoretical considerations, tipranavir or ritonavir conc entrations might increase upon co-administration with itraconazole or ketoconazole.Voriconazole 
 No interaction study performed 
 Due to multiple CYP isoenzy me systems involved in voriconazole metabolism, it is difficult to predict the interaction with tipranavir, co -administered with low -dose ritonavir.Based on the known interaction of voriconazole with low dose ritonavir (see voriconazole Sm 
 PC) the co -administration of tipranavir/r and voriconazole should be avoided, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of voriconazole.Anti -gouts 
 Colchicine 
 No interaction study performed 
 Based on theoretical considerations, colchicine concentrations may increase upon co -administration with tipranavir and low dose ritonavir , due to tipranavir/ritonavir CYP3A and P -gp inhibition. However a decrease of colchicine concentrations cannot be excluded since both tipranavir and ritonavir exhibit inducing potential towards CYP3A and P -gp.Colchicine is a substrate of CYP3A4 and P -gp (an intestinal efflux transporter).A reduction in colchicine dosage or an interruption of colchicine treatment is recommended in patients with normal renal or hepatic function if treatment with Aptivus/ritonavir is required (see section 4.4).In patients with renal or hepatic impairment, co -administration of colchicine in patients on Aptivus/ritonavir is contraindicated(see section 4.3) .Antibiotics

The increase of tipranavir Cminmay be clinically relevant. Patients using clarithromycin at doses higher than 500 mg twice daily should be carefully monitored for signs of toxicity of clarithromycin and tipranavir. For patients with renal impairment dose reduction of clarithromycin should be considered (see clarithromycin and ritonavir product information).Rifabutin 150mg QD Rifabutin C max↑ 70%Rifabutin AUC ↑ 190% Rifabutin C min↑ 114%

25-O-desacetylrifabutin AUC ↑ 21 Dosage reductions of rifabutin by at least 75% of the usual 300 mg/day are recommended (ie 150 mg on alternate days, or three times per week). Patients receiving rifabutin with Aptivus, co -administered with low dose ritonavir, should be 14fold
25-O-desacetylrifabutin C min↑ 7.8 fold Inhibition of CYP 3A4 by tipranavir/r 
 No clinically significant change is observed in tipranavir PK parameters.closely monitored for emergence of adverse events associated with rifabutin therapy. Further dosage reduction may be necessary.Rifampicin Co-administration of protease inhibitors with rifampicin substantially decreases protease inhibitor concentrations. In the case of tipranavir co -administered with low dose ritonavir, concomitant use with rifampicin is expected to result in sub -optimal levels of tipranavir which may lead to loss of virologic response and possible resist ance to tipranavir.Concomitant use of Aptivus, co -administered with low dose ritonavir, and rifampicin is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Alternate antimycobacterial agents such as rifabutin should be considered.Antimalarial

Pravastatin 
 No interaction study performed 
 Based on similarities in the elimination between pravastatin and rosuvastatin, TPV/r could increase the plasma levels of pravastatin. Mechanism unknown.Co-administration of Aptivus, co -administered with low dose ritonavir, and pravastatin should be initiated with the lowest dose (10mg/day) of pravastatin, titrated to treatment response, and accompanied with careful clinical monitoring for pravastatin associated symptoms as described in the label of pravastatin.Simvastatin

 Tipranavir ↔The combined use of Aptivus, co -administered with low dose ritonavir, with either omeprazole or esomeprazole is not recommended (see se ction 4.4). If unavoidable, upward dose adjustments for either omeprazole or esomeprazole may be considered based on clinical response to therapy. There are no data available indicating that omeprazole or esomeprazole dose adjustments will overcome the observed pharmacokinetic interaction. Recommendations for maximal doses of omeprazole or esomeprazole are found in the corresponding product information. No tipranavir with ritonavir dose adjustment is required.Lansoprazole 
 Pantoprazole 
 Rabeprazole 
 No interaction study performed 
 Based on the metabolic profiles of tipranavir/r and the proton pump inhibitors, an interaction can be expected. As a result of CYP3A4 inhibition and CYP2C19 induction by tipranavir/r, lansoprazole and pantoprazole plasma concentrations are difficult to predict. Rabeprazole plasma concentrations might decrease as a result of induction of CYP2C19 by tipranavir/r.The combined use of Aptivus, co -administered with low dose ritonavir, with proton pump inhibitors is not recommen ded (see section 4.4). If the co -administration is judged unavoidable, this should be done under close clinical monitoring.19H2-receptor antagonists

 Ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and therefore affect drugs metabolised by this enzyme.Concomitant use of Aptivus, co -administered with low dose ritonavir, and sedative/hypnotics such as oral midazolam is contra -indicated (see section 4.3). If Aptivus with ritonavir is administered with parenteral midazolam, close clinical monitoring for respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation should be instituted and dosage adjustment shou ld be considered.Triazolam 
 No interaction study performed 
 Based on theoretical considerations, tipranavir, co -administered with low dose ritonavir, is expected to increase triazolam concentrations.Inhibition of CYP 3A4 by tipranavir/r 
 The concomitant use of Aptivus, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, with triazolam is contraindicated due to potential serious and/or life threatening events (see section 4.3)Nucleoside analogue DNA polymerase inhibitors

 Theophylline 
 No interaction study performed 
 Based on data from the cocktail study where caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate) AUC was reduced by 
43%, tipranavir with ritonavir is expected to decrease theophylline concentrations.  Induction of CYP 1A2 by Theophylline plasma concentrations should be monitored during the first two weeks of co -administration with Aptivus, co -administered with low dose ritonavir, and the theophylline dose should be increased as needed.21tipranavir/r

 Interaction study performed only with ritonavir 
 In a pharmacokinetic study performed in healthy volunteers, concomitant use of low dose ritonavir (200 mg twice daily) with a single dose of trazodone led to an increased plasma concentration of trazodone (AUC increased by 
2.4fold). Adverse events of nausea, dizziness, hypote nsion and syncope have been observed following co -administration of trazodone and ritonavir in this study. However, it is unknown whether the combination of tipranavir with ritonavir might cause a larger increase in trazodone exposure.The combination shou ld be used with caution and a lower dose of trazodone should be considered.Bupropion 150mg BID Bupropion C max↓ 51% Bupropion AUC ↓ 56%Tipranavir ↔The reduction of bupropion plasma levels is likely due to induction of CYP2B6 and UGT activity by R TVIf the co -administration with bupropion is judged unavoidable, this should be done under close clinical monitoring for bupropion efficacy, without exceeding the recommended dosage, despite the observed induction.Loperamide 16mg QD Loperamide C max↓ 61% Loperamide AUC ↓ 51% Mechanism unknown

The clinical relevance of the reduced loperamide plasma concentration is unknown. Fluticasone propionate 
 Interaction study performed only with ritonavir 
 In a clinical study where ritonavir 
100mg capsules bid were co -administered with 50 µg intranasal flutic asone propionate (4 times daily) for 7 days in healthy subjects, the fluticasone propionate plasma levels increased significantly, whereas the intrinsic cortisol levels decreased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82 -89%). Greater effects may be expected when fluticasone propionate is inhaled. Systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression have been reported in patients receiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasally administered fluticasone propionate; this could also occur with other corticosteroids metabolised via the P450 3A pathway e.g. budesonide. It is unknown whether the combination of tipranavir with ritonavir might cause a larger increase in fluticasone exposure.Concomitant administration of Aptivu s, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, and these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 4.4). A dose reduction of the glucocorticoid should be con sidered with close monitoring of local and systemic effects or a switch to a glucocorticoid, which is not a substrate for CYP3A4 (e.g. beclomethasone). Moreover, in case of withdrawal of glucocorticoids progressive dose reduction may have to be performed o ver a longer period. The effects of high fluticasone systemic exposure on ritonavir plasma levels are as yet unknown.
