4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 No interaction studies have been performed (see section 5.2).Based on in vitro data, coadministration of inotuzumab ozogamicin with inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 (CYP) or uridine diphosphate -glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) drug metabolising enzymes are unlikely to alter exposure to N -acetyl -gamma -calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide . In addition, inotuzumab ozogamicin and N -acetyl -gamma -calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide are unlikely to alter the exposure of substrates of CYP enzymes, and N -acetyl -gamma -calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide is unlikely to alter the exposure of substrates of UGT enzymes or major drug transporters.In patients receiving inotuzumab ozogamicin ,prolonged QT interval was observed (see section 4.4) . Therefore, the concomitant use of inotuzumab ozogamicin with medicinal products known to prolong QT interval or to induce Torsades de P ointes should be carefully considered. The QT interval should be mo nitored in case of combinations of such medicinal products ( see section s4.4, 4.8,and 5.2 ).
