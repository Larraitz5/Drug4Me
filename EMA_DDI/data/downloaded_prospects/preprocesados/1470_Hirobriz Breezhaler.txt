4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Sympathomimetic medicinal products  
 Concomitant administration of other sympathomimetic medicinal products  (alone or as part of combination therapy) may potentiate adverse reactions to  Hirobriz  Breezhaler . 
 Hirobriz  Breezhaler  should not be used in conjunction with other long -acting beta 2-adrenergic agonists or medicinal products containing long -acting beta 2-adrenergic agonists.  
 5 Hypokalaemi c treatment  
 Concomitant hypokalaemic treatment with methylxanthine derivatives, steroids, or non -potassium -sparing diuretics may potentiate the possible hypokalaemic effect of beta 2-adrenergic agonists , therefore caution is required (see section  4.4). 
 Beta-adrenergic blockers  
 Beta-adrenergic blockers and beta 2-adrenergic agonists may weaken or antagonise the effect of each other when administered concurrently. Therefore indacaterol should not be given together with beta -adrenergic blockers (including eye drops) unless there are compelling reasons for their use. Where required, cardioselective beta -adrenergic blockers should be preferred, although they should be administered with caution.  
 Metabolic and transporter based i nteraction s 
 Inhibition of the key contributors of indacaterol clearance, CYP3A4 and P -glycoprotein (P -gp) raises the systemic exposure of indacaterol by up to two -fold. The magnitude of exposure increases due to interactions does not raise any safety concerns given the safety experience of treatment with Hirobriz  Breezhaler  in clinical studies of up to one year at doses up to twice the maximum recommended therapeutic do se. 
 Indacaterol  has not been shown to cause interactions with medicinal products administered concomitantly . In vitro  investigations have indicated that indacaterol has negligible potential to cause metabolic interactions with medic inal products  at the sy stemic exposure levels achieved in clinical practice.
