4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Transporter -mediated interactions  
 Odevixibat is a substrate for the efflux transporter P- glycoprotein ( P-gp). In adult healthy subjects, co-administration of the strong P -gp inhibitor itraconazole increased the plasma exposure of a single dose of odevixibat 7 200  mcg  by approximately 50-60%.  This increase is not considered clinically relevant.  No other potentially relevant t ransporter- mediated interactions were identified in vitro  (see section  5.2). 
 Cytochrome P450- mediated interactions  
 In vitro , odevixibat did not induce CYP enzym es (see section  5.2). 
 In in vitro  studies, odevixibat was shown to be an inhibitor of CYP3A4 /5 (see section  5.2).  
 In adult healthy subjects, concomitant use of odevixibat decreased the area under the curve ( AUC ) of oral midazolam  (a CYP3A4 substrate) by 30 % and 1- OH-midazolam exposure by less than 20%, which is  not considered clinically relevant.  
 No interaction studies have been conducted with UDCA and rifampicin. 
 In an interaction study with a lipophilic combination oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol (EE) (0.03 mg) and levonorgestrel (LVN) (0.15 mg) conducted in adult healthy females, concomitant use o f odevixibat had no impact on the AUC of LVN and decreased the AUC of EE by 17%, which is not considered clinically relevant. Interaction studies with other lipophilic medicinal products have not been performed , therefore, an effect on the absorption of other fat-soluble medicinal products cannot be excluded. 
 In clinical trials , decreased levels of fat -soluble vitamins were observed in some patient s receiving odevixibat. Levels of fat-soluble vitamins should be monitored (see section  4.4). 6  Paediatric population 
 No interaction studies have been performed in paediatric patients.  No differences are expected between the adult and paediatric populations.
