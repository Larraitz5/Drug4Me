4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Co-administration of Nuvaxovid with inactivated influenza vaccines has been evaluated in a limited number of participants in an exploratory clinical trial sub -study, see section 4.8 and section 5.1.  
 The binding antibody response to SARS -Co 
 V-2 was lower when Nuvaxovid was given concomitantly with inactivated influenza vaccine. The clinical significance of this is unknown.  
 Concomitant administration of Nuvaxovid with other vaccines has not been studied.
