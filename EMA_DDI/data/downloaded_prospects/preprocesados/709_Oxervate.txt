4.5  Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Other topical ophthalmic products may be used during treatment with OXERVATE when used 15 minutes apart, with the exception of agents known to inhibit epithelial healing (e.g. corticosteroids or eye drops containing prese rvatives such as benzalkonium chloride, p olyquaternium -1, benzododecinium  brom ide, cetrimide  and other quaternary ammonium derivative s) (see sections 
4.2 and 4.4).  If eye ointment, gel or other viscous eye drops are used, OXERVATE should be administered first. 
 No interaction studies with other medicinal products have been performed.  As systemic absorption of cenegermin after use of the medicinal product  is negligible or not detectable, no drug interactions are anticipated.
