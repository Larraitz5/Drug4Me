 Sodium content   
 This medicinal product  contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23  mg) per 300  mg dose, that is to say  essentially ‘sodium -free’.  
 
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction   
 Immune responses to vaccination were assessed in a study in which patients with atopic dermatitis were treated once weekly for 16 weeks with 300 mg of dupilumab. After 12 weeks of dupilumab administration, patients were vaccinated with a Tdap vaccine (T cell -dependent), and a  meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (T cell -independent) and immune responses were assessed 4 weeks later. Antibody responses to both tetanus vaccine and meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine were similar in dupilumab -treated and placebo -treated patients.  No adverse interactions between either of the non -live vaccines and dupilumab were noted in the study.  
 Therefore, patients receiving dupilumab may receive concurrent inactivated or non -live vaccinations.  For information on live vaccines see section 4.4.  
 In a clinical study of atopic dermatitis patients, the effects of dupilumab on the pharmacokinetics ( PK) of CYP substrates were evaluated. The data gathered from this study did not indicate clinically relevant effects of dupilumab on CYP1A2, CYP3A, CYP2C 19, CYP2D6, or CYP2C9 activity.  
 An effect of dupilumab on the PK of co -administered medicinal products  is not expected. Based on the population analysis, commonly co -administered medicinal products  had no effect on dupilumab pharmacokinetics on patients w ith moderate to severe asthma.
