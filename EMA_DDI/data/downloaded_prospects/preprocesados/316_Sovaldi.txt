4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 Sofosbuvir is a nucleotide prodrug.  After oral administration of Sovaldi, sofosbuvir is rapidly absorbed and subject to extensive first-pass hepatic and intestinal metabolism. Intracellular hydrolytic prodrug cleavage catalysed by enzymes including carboxylesterase 1 and sequential phosphorylation steps catalysed by nucleotide kinases result in formation of the pharmacologically active uridine nucleoside analogue t riphosphate.  The predominant inactive circulating metabolite GS-331007 that accounts for greater than 90% of drug-related material systemic exposure is formed through pathways sequential and parallel to formation of active metabolite.  The parent sofosbuvir  accounts for approximately 4% of drug- related material systemic exposure (see section  5.2). In clinical pharmacology studies, both sofosbuvir and GS -331007 were monitored for purposes of pharmacokinetic analyses.  
 Sofosbuvir is a substrate of drug transporter P -gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) while GS-331007 is not.  
 Medicinal products that are strong P -gp inducers in the intestine (carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin and St.  John’s wort) may significantly decrease sofosbuvir plasma concentration leading to reduced therapeutic effect of Sovaldi and thus are contraindicated with Sovaldi (see section  4.3). Medicinal products that are moderate P- gp inducers in the intestine (e.g. modafinil, oxcarbazepine and rifapentine) may decrease sofosbuvir plasma concentration leading to reduced therapeutic effect of Sovaldi.  Co-administration with such medicinal products is not recommended with Sovaldi (see section  4.4). Co-administration of Sovaldi with medicinal products that inhibit P-gp and/or BCRP may increase sofosbuvir plasma concentration without increasing GS -331007 plasma concentration, thus Sovaldi may be co-administered with P-gp and/or BCRP  inhibitors. Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 are not inhibitors of P -gp and BCRP and thus are not expected to increase exposures of medicinal products that are substrates of these transporters.  
 The intracellular metabolic activation pathway of sofosbuvir is mediated by generally low affinity and high capacity hydrolase and nucleotide phosphorylation pathways that are unlikely to be affected by concomitant medicinal products (see section  5.2). 
 Patients treated with vitamin K antagonists  
 As liver function may change during treatment with Sovaldi, a close monitoring of International Normali sed Ratio (INR) values is recommended.  
 Impact of DAA therapy on drugs metabolized by the liver  
 The pharmacokinetics of drugs that are metabolized by the liver (e.g. immunosuppressive agents such as calcineurin inhibitors) may be impacted by changes in liver function during DAA therapy, related to clearance of HCV.
