4.5 Interaction with other medicinal p roducts and other forms of interaction  
 No interaction studies h ave been performed in humans.  Ioflupane binds to the dopamine transporter. Active substance s that bind to the dopamine transporter with  high a ffinity may therefore interfere with Striascan  diagnosis. These include : 
- amfetamine,  
- benzatropine,  
- bupropion ,  
- cocaine,  
- mazindol,  
- methylphenidate,  
- phentermine and  
- sertraline.  
 Active substance s shown during cl inical tr ials not to interfere wit h Strias can imaging include : 
- amantadine,  
- trihexyphenidyl,   
- budipine,  
- levodopa,  
- metoprolol,  
- primidone,  
- propranolol and   
- selegiline.  
 Dopamine agonists and antagonists acting on the postsynaptic dopamine receptors are not expec ted to interfere with Striascan  imaging and can therefore be continued if desired. Medicinal products shown in animal studies not to interfere with  Striascan  imaging include pergolide.
