4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 No interaction studies have been performed in humans.  
  5 Ioflupane  binds to the dopamine transporter. Medicines that bind to the dopamine transporter with high affinity may the refore interfere with Da 
 TSCAN diagnosis. These include amfetamine, benzatropine, buproprion, cocaine, mazindol, methylphenidate, phentermine  and s ertraline.  
 Medicines shown during clinical trials not to interfere with Da 
 TSCAN imaging include amantadine, trihex yphenidyl, budipine, levodopa, metoprolol, primidone, propranolol and selegiline. Dopamine agonists and antagonists acting on the postsynapti c dopamine receptors are not expected to interfere with Da 
 TSCAN imaging and can therefore be continued if desi red. Medicinal products shown in animal studies not to interfere with Da 
 TSCAN imaging include pergolide.
