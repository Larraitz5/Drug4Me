4.5 Interaction with other medi cinal products and other forms of interaction 
 Effect of other medi cinal produc ts on sodium zirconium cyclosi licate 
 As sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is not absorbed or meta bolised by the b ody,there are no expected effects of other medicinal products on the pharm acologic action of sodium zirconium c yclosilicat e.Effect of sodium z irconiu m cyclosilicate on othe rmedicinal products 
 As sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is not abs orbed or metabol isedby the body,and does not meaningfully bind other medicin al products,there are limite d effects on other m edici nal pro ducts. Sodium zirconi um cyclosilicate can transient ly increase gastric p 
 H by absorbing hydrogen ions and can l ead to changes in solub ilityand abso rption kinetics for co -administered medicinal pr oductswith p 
 H-dependent bioavailability .In a cl inica l drug -drug inte raction stud y conduc ted in healthy subject sco-administration of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate with amlodip ine, clopidogrel ,atorvastatin , furosemide, glipizide, warfarin, losartan or l evothyroxine did not result i n clinically meaning ful drug-drug interac tions.Consi stent wi th co-administration o fdabigatran with other gastric acid modifiers,dabigatran Cmaxand 
 AUC values wer eapproximatel y 40% lower when co -administered with sodium zirconiumcyclosilicate . No doseadjustmen tsor sepa ration of ti me of dos ing are requ ired forany of these medicina lproduc ts.However, sodium zirconium cyclosilicate should be admi nistered at leas t
2hours befo re or 2 hours after oral medic inal products withclinicallymeaningful gastric p 
 H dependent bioavailability.Examples of medicinal products that should be admi nistered 2 hours before or after sodium zirconium cyclosilicate to avoid possible raised gastric p 
 H dru g interaction are azole antifungals (k etoconazol e, itraconazole andposaconazole), a nti-HIV agents (atazanavir , nelfin avir, indinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir,raltegravir, ledipasvir andrilpivirine) and tyrosine kinase inhibit ors(erlotinib, d asatinibandnilotinib).Sodium zirconium cy closilica tecan b e co-administer ed without spa cing of dosing time swithoral medicinalproducts that do not exh ibit p 
 H -dependent bioavailability. 5Inanotherdrug-druginteractionstudyinhealthyvolunteers,co-administrationof
