4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 Voriconazole is metabolised by, and inhibits the activity of, cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4. Inhibitors or inducers of these isoenzym es may incr ease or decrease voriconazole plasma concentrations, respectively, and there is potential for voriconazole to increase the plasma concentrations of substances metabolised by these CYP450 isoenzymes, in particular for substances  metabolised by CY P3A4 since vori conazole is a strong CYP3A4 inhibito r though the increase in AUC is  substrate dependent (see Table below).  
 Unless otherwise specified, drug interaction studies have been performed in healthy adult male subjects using multiple dosing to s teady state with  oral voriconazole at 200 mg twice daily (BID). These results are relevant to other populations and routes of administration.  
 Voriconazole should be administered with  caution in patients with concomitant medication that is known to prolon g QTc interval. When there is also a potenti al for v oriconazole to increase the plasma concentrations of substances metabolised by CYP3A4 isoenzymes (certain antihistamines, quinidine, cisapride, pimozide and ivabradine ), co-administration is contraindica ted (see below and section 4.3).   
 Interaction table  
 Intera ctions between voriconazole and other medicinal products are listed in the table below (once daily as 
“QD”, twice daily as “BID”, three times daily as “TID” and not determined as “ND”). The direction of the arrow for each pharmacokinetic parameter is based  on the 90% confidence interval of the geometric mean ratio being within ( ↔), below (↓) or above (↑) the 80 -125% range. The asterisk (*) indicates a two -way interaction. AUC τ, AUC t and AUC 0-∞ represent area under the curve over a dosing interval, from time zero to  the time with detectable measurement and from time zero to infinity, respectively.  
 The interactions in the table are presented in  the following order: contraindications, those requiring dose adjustment and careful clinical and/or biological moni toring, and finally those that have no significant pharmacokinetic interaction but may be of clinical interest in this therapeutic field.  11

 When initiati ng voriconazole in patients already on ciclosporin it is recommended that the ciclosporin dose be halved and ciclosporin level carefully monitored. Increased ciclosporin levels have been associated with nephrot oxicity. When voriconazole is discontinued, ciclosporin levels must be carefully monitored and the dose increased as necessary .  
 When initiating voriconazole in patients already on tacrolimus, it is recommended that the tacrolimus dose be reduced to a thi rd of t he original dose and tacrolimus level carefully monitored.
