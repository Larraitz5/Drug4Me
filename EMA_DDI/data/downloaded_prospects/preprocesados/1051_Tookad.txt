4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 OATP1B1 and OATP 1B3 transporters  In vitro  studies predict that TOOKAD at therapeutic concentrations is unlikely to inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes but could  inhibit  OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 transporters (see section  5.2). 
 The magnitude of interaction has not been investigated clinically but a transient increase in the plasma concentration of co-administered substrates of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3  cannot be ruled out. The use  of medicinal products that are substrates of OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 (repaglinide, atorvastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin, bosentan, glyburide) for which concentration -dependent serious adverse reactions have been observed should be avoided on the day of TOOKAD infusion and for at least 24  hours after administration. Co-administration should be done  with caution and close monitoring is recommended.  
 Photosensitisers  Medicinal products which have potential photosensitising effects (such as tetracyclines, sulphonamides, quinolones, phenothiazines, s ulfonylurea hypoglycaemic agents, thiazide diuretics, griseofulvin or amiodarone) should be stopped at least 10 days before the procedure with TOOKAD and for at least 3  days after the procedure or replaced by other treatments without photosensitis ing properties. If it is not possible to stop a photosensitising medicinal product (such as amiodarone) , the 7 patient should be advised that increased sensitivity to sunlight may occur and they may need to protect themselves from direct light exp osure for a longer period (see section  4.2). 
 Anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents  Anticoagulant medicinal products and those that decr ease platelet aggregation (e.g. acetylsalicylic acid) should be stopped at least 10 days before the procedure with TOOKAD. Medicinal p roducts that prevent or reduce platelet aggregation should not be started for at least 3  days after the procedure.
