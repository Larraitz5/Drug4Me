4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No formal pharmacokinetic interaction studies have been conducted with atezolizumab. Since atezolizumab is cleared from the circulation through catabolism, no metabolic drug- drug interactions are expected.  
 The use of systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants before starting atezolizumab should be avoided because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy of atezolizumab. However, systemic corticosteroids or other immu nosuppressants can be used to treat immune -mediated  adverse reactions after starting atezolizumab (see section 4.4).
