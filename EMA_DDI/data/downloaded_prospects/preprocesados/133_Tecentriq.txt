4.5 Interaction with other medici nal products and other forms o f interaction 
 No formal pharmacokinetic inter action studies have been conduct ed with atezolizumab. Since atezolizumab is cleared from the circulation through catabolism , no metabolic drug-drug interactions are expected.   The use of systemic corticos teroids or immunosuppressants befor e starting atezolizumab should be avoided because of their potentia l interference with the pharma codynamic activity and efficacy of atezolizumab. However, systemic co rticosteroids or other immuno suppressants can be used to treat immune-mediated adverse reactions  after starting atezolizumab ( see section 4.4).
