4.5 In case of withdrawal of ritonavir from the recommended atazanavir boosted regimen) or in case of perceived challenging compliance.  
  7 REYATAZ given without ritonavir should not be used in pregnant patients given that it could result in suboptimal exposure of particular concern for the mother infection and vertical transmission. 
 Cholelithiasis  
 Cholelithiasis has been reported in patients receiving REYATAZ (see section  4.8). Some patients required hospitalization for additional management and some had complications. If signs or symptoms of cholelithiasis occur, temporary interruption or discontinuation of treatment may be considered. 
 Chronic kidney disease 
 Chronic kidney disease in HIV- infected patients treated with atazanavir, with or without ritonavir, has been reported during postmarketing surveillance. A large prospective observational study has shown an association between an increased incidence of chronic kidney disease and cumulative exposure to atazanavir/ritonavir-containing regimen in HIV-infected patients with an initially normal e 
 GFR. This association was observed independently of exposure to tenofovir disoproxil. Regular monitoring of the renal function of patients should be maintained throughout the treatment duration (see section  4.8). 
 Nephrolithiasis 
 Nephrolithiasis has been reported in patients receiving REYATAZ (see section  4.8). Some patients required hospitalization for additional management and some had complications. In some cases, nephrolithiasis has been associated with acute renal failure or renal insufficiency. If signs or symptoms of nephrolithiasis occur, temporary interruption or discontinuation of treatment may be considered. 
 Immune reactivation syndrome 
 In HIV -infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occurs many months after initiation of treatment.  
 Osteonecrosis  
 Although the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement.  
 Rash and associated syndromes  
 Rashes are usually mild -to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions that occur within the first 3  weeks of starting therapy with REYATAZ. 
 Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), erythema multiforme, toxic skin eruptions and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported in patients receiving REYATAZ. Patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored closely for skin reactions. REYATAZ should be discontinued if severe rash develops. 
  8 The best results in managing these events come from early diagnosis and immediate interruption of any suspect medicines. If the patient has developed SJS or DRESS associated with the use of REYATAZ, REYATAZ may not be restarted.  
 Interactions with other medicinal products  
 The combination of REYATAZ with atorvastatin is not recommended (see section  4.5). 
 Co-administration of REYATAZ with nevirapine or efavirenz is not recommended (see section  4.5). If the co -administration of REYATAZ with an NNRTI is required, an increase in the dose of both REYATAZ and ritonavir to 400 mg and 200 mg, respectively, in combination with efavirenz could be considered with close clinical monitoring.  Atazanavir is metabolised principally by CYP3A4. Co-administration of REYATAZ and medicinal products that induce CYP3A4 is not recommended (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). 
 PDE5 inhibitors used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction: particular caution should be used when prescribing PDE5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil) for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in patients receiving REYATAZ. Co- administration of REYATAZ with these medicinal products is expected to substantially increase their concentrations and may result in PDE5 -associated adverse reactions such as hypotension, visual changes, and priapism (see  section  4.5). 
 Co-administration of voriconazole and REYATAZ with ritonavir is not recommended, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk justifies the use of voriconazole.  
 In the majority of patients, a reduction in both voriconazole and atazanavir exposures are expected. In a small number of patients without a functional CYP2C19 allele, significantly increased voriconazole exposures are expected (see  section  4.5). 
 Concomitant use of REYATAZ/ritonavir and fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised by CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression (see section  4.5). 
 Concomitant use of salmeterol and REYATAZ may result in increased cardiovascular adverse events associated with salmeterol. Co -administration of salmeterol and REYATAZ is not recommended (see section  4.5).
 
 The absorption of atazanavir may be reduced in situations where gastric p 
 H is increased irrespective of cause.  
 Co-administration of REYATAZ with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended (see section  4.5). If the combination of REYATAZ with a proton pump inhibitor is judged unavoidable, close clinical monitoring is recommended in combination with an increase in the dose of REYATAZ to 400 mg with 100 mg of ritonavir; doses of proton pump inhibitors comparable to omeprazole 20 mg should not be exceeded.  
 Co-administration of REYATAZ with other hormonal contraceptives or oral contraceptives containing progestogens other than norgestimate or norethindrone has not been studied, and therefore should be avoided (see section  4.5). 
 Paediatric population 
 Safety Asymptomatic PR interval prolongation was more frequent in paediatric patients than adults. Asymptomatic first- and second- degree AV block was reported in paediatric patients (see section  4.8). Caution should be used with medicinal products known to induce PR prolongations. In paediatric  9 patients with pre-existing conduction problems (second degree or higher atrioventricular or complex bundle-branch block), REYATAZ should be used with caution and only if the benefits exceed the risk. Cardiac monitoring is recommended based on the presence of clinical findings (e.g., bradycardia). 
 Efficacy  Atazanavir/ritonavir is not effective in viral strains harbouring multiple mutations of resistance.  
 Excipients  
 Lactose  Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency , or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
 
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 When REYATAZ and ritonavir are co -administered, the metabolic drug interaction profile for ritonavir may predominate because ritonavir is a more potent CYP3A4 inhibitor than atazanavir. The Summary of Product Characteristics for ritonavir must be consulted before initiation of therapy with REYATAZ and ritonavir. 
 Atazanavir is metabolised in the liver through CYP3A4. It inhibits CYP3A4. Therefore, REYATAZ is contraindicated with medicinal products that are substrates of CYP3A4 and have a narrow therapeutic index: quetiapine, lurasidone, alfuzosin, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, bepridil, triazolam, orally administered midazolam, lomitapide, and ergot alkaloids, particularly ergotamine and dihydroergotamine (see section  4.3). Co-administration of REYATAZ with grazoprevir -containing products, including elbasvir/grazoprevir fixed -dose combination is contraindicated because of the increase in grazoprevir and elbasvir plasma concentrations and potential for the increase in risk of ALT elevations associated with increased grazoprevir concentrations (see section  4.3). Co- administration of REYATAZ with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir fixed -dose combination is contraindicated because of the potential increase in the risk of ALT elevations due to a significant increase in glecapreir and pibrentasvir plasma concentrations (see section  4.3). 
 Other interactions  Interactions between atazanavir and other medicinal products are listed in the table below (increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”). If available, 90% confidence intervals (CI) are shown in parentheses. The studies presented in Table  2 were conducted in healthy subjects unless otherwise noted. Of importance, many studies were conducted with unboosted atazanavir, which is not the recommended regimen of atazanavir (see section  4.4). 
 If withdrawal of ritonavir is medically warranted under restrictive conditions (see  section  4.4), special attention should be given to atazanavir interactions that may differ in the absence of ritonavir (see information below Table  2).

 The mechanism of interaction between REYATAZ/ritonavir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir is inhibition of OATP1B, P -gp, and CYP3A.  Co-administration of REYATAZ with voxilaprevir -containing products is expected to increase the concentration of voxilaprevir. Co-administration of REYATAZ with voxilaprevir -containing regimens is not recommended.   11 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co -administration  Glecaprevir

*Effect of atazanavir and ritonavir on the first dose of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir is reported.  Co-administration of REYATAZ with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir is contraindicated because of the potential increase in the risk of ALT elevations due to a significant increase in glecaprevir and pibrentasvir plasma concentrations (see section  4.3) ANTIPLATELETS  Ticagrelor  The mechanism of the interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition by atazanavir and/or ritonavir.  Co-administration of REYATAZ with ticagrelor is not recommended due to potential increase in the antiplatelet activity of ticagrelor.  Clopidogrel  The mechanism of the interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition by atazanavir and or/ritonavir.  Co-administration with clopidogrel is not recommended due to potential reduction of the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel.  Prasugrel  The mechanism of the interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition by atazanavir and or/ritonavir.  No dose adjustment is needed when prasugrel is co -administered with REYATAZ (with or without ritonavir).  ANTI -RETROVIRALS  Protease inhibitors:  The co -administration of REYATAZ/ritonavir and other protease inhibitors has not been studied but would be expected to increase exposure to other protease inhibitors. Therefore, such co- administration is not recommended.  Ritonavir 100  mg once daily  (atazanavir 300  mg once daily)  
 Studies conducted in HIV -infected patients.  Atazanavir AUC: ↑250% (↑144%

 *In a combined analysis, atazanavir 300 mg and ritonavir 100 mg (n  = 33) was compared to atazanavir 400  mg without ritonavir (n  = 28). 
 The mechanism of interaction between atazanavir and ritonavir is CYP3A4 inhibition.  Ritonavir 100  mg once daily is used as a booster of atazanavir pharmacokinetics. Indinavir  Indinavir is associated with indirect unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia due to inhibition of UGT.  Co-administration of REYATAZ and indinavir is not recommended (see section  4.4). Nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)  Lamivudine 150  mg twice daily 
+ zidovudine 300  mg twice daily  (atazanavir 400  mg once daily)  No significant effect on lamivudine and zidovudine concentrations was observed.  Based on these data and because ritonavir is not expected to have a significant impact on the pharmacokinetics of NRTIs, the co -administration of these medicinal products and REYATAZ is not expected to significantly alter the exposure of the co- administered medicinal products.   12 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co -administration  Abacavir  The co-administration of abacavir and REYATAZ is not expected to significantly alter the exposure of abacavir.

 Atazanavir concentrations were greatly decreased when co -administered with didanosine (buffered tablets) and stavudine. The mechanism of interaction is a reduced solubility of atazanavir with increasing p 
 H related to the presence of anti-acid agent in didanosine buffered tablets.  
 No significant effect on didanosine and stavudine concentrations was observed.  Didanosine  should be taken at the fasted state 2  hours after REYATAZ taken with food. The co-administration of stavudine with REYATAZ is not expected to significantly alter the exposure of stavudine.  Didanosine (enteric coated capsules) 400 mg single dose  (atazanavir 300  mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily)  Didanosine (with food)  Didanosine AUC : ↓34% (↓41% ↓27%)  Didanosine C max: ↓38% (↓48% ↓26%)  Didanosine C min: ↑25% (↓8% ↑69%)  
 No significant effect on atazanavir concentrations was observed when administered with enteric -coated didanosine, but administration with food decreased didanosine concentrations.  Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 
300 mg once daily (atazanavir 300  mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily)  
 300 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is equivalent to 245 mg tenofovir disoproxil.

 * In a combined analysis from several clinical studies, atazanavir/ritonavir 
300/100 mg co -administered with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg (n = 39) was compared to atazanavir/ritonavir 300/100 mg (n  = 33). 
 The efficacy of REYATAZ/ritonavir in combination with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in treatment -experienced patients has been demonstrated in clinical study 045 and in treatment naïve  patients in clinical study  138 (see  sections  4.8 and 5.1). The mechanism of interaction between atazanavir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is unknown.  When co -administered with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, it is recommended that REYATAZ 300 mg be given with ritonavir 
100 mg and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300  mg (all as a single dose with food).   13 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co -administration  Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 
300 mg once daily (atazanavir 300  mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily)

*When compared to REYATAZ 300 mg and ritonavir 100 mg without nevirapine. This decrease in atazanavir C min might negatively impact the efficacy of atazanavir. The mechanism of nevirapine/atazanavir interaction is CYP3A4 induction.  Co-administration of nevirapine and REYATAZ is not recommended (see section  4.4). Integrase Inhibitors  Raltegravir 400  mg twice daily  (atazanavir/ritonavir)  Raltegravir AUC : ↑41%  Raltegravir C max: ↑24%  Raltegravir C 12hr: ↑77%  
 The mechanism is UGT1A1 inhibition.  No dose adjustment required for raltegravir.   14 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co -administration  ANTIBIOTICS  Clarithromycin 500  mg twice daily  (atazanavir 400  mg once daily)  Clarithromycin AUC : ↑94% (↑75%

 A dose reduction of clarithromycin may result in subtherapeutic concentrations of 14-OH clarithromycin.  
 The mechanism of the clarithromycin/atazanavir interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition.  No recommendation regarding dose reduction can be made; therefore, caution should be exercised if REYATAZ is co -administered with clarithromycin.  ANTIFUNGALS  Ketoconazole 200  mg once daily  (atazanavir 400  mg once daily)  No significant effect on atazanavir concentrations was observed.  Ketoconazole and itraconazole should be used cautiously with REYATAZ/ritonavir, high doses of ketoconazole and itraconazole (> 200 mg/day) are not recommended.  Itraconazole  Itraconazole, like ketoconazole, is a potent inhibitor as well as a substrate of CYP3A4.  
 Based on data obtained with other boosted PIs and ketoconazole, where ketoconazole AUC showed a 3 -fold increase, REYATAZ/ritonavir is expected to increase ketoconazole or itraconazole concentrations.   15 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co -administration  Voriconazole 200  mg twice daily (atazanavir 300  mg/ritonavir 
100 mg once daily)  
 Subjects with at least one functional CYP2C19 allele.  Voriconazole AUC : ↓33% (↓42% ↓22%)  Voriconazole C max: ↓10% (↓22% ↓4%)  Voriconazole C min: ↓39% (↓49% ↓28%)  
 Atazanavir AUC : ↓12% (↓18% ↓5%)  Atazanavir C max: ↓13% (↓20% ↓4%)  Atazanavir C min: ↓20% (↓28% ↓10%)  
 Ritonavir AUC : ↓12% (↓17% ↓7%)  Ritonavir Cmax: ↓9% (↓17% ↔0%)  Ritonavir C min: ↓25% (↓35% ↓14%)  
 In the majority of patients with at least one functional CYP2C19 allele, a reduction in both voriconazole and atazanavir exposures are expected.  Co-administration of voriconazole and REYATAZ with ritonavir is not recommended unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of voriconazole (see  section  4.4). 
 At the time voriconazole treatment is required, a patient's CYP2C19 genotype should be performed if feasible. 
 Therefore if the combination is unavoidable, the following recommendations are made according to the CYP2C19 status:  
- in patients with at least one functional CYP2C19 allele, close clinical monitoring for a loss of both voriconazole (clinical signs) and atazanavir (virologic response) efficacy is recommended.  
 - in patients without a functional CYP2C19 allele, close clinical and laboratory monitoring of voriconazole -associated adverse events is recommended.  
 If genotyping is not feasible, full monitoring of safety and efficacy should be performed.  Voriconazole 50  mg twice daily (atazanavir 300 mg/ritonavir 
100 mg once daily)  
 Subjects without a functional CYP2C19 allele.  Voriconazole AUC : ↑561% (↑451%

 In a small number of patients without a functional CYP2C19 allele, significantly increased voriconazole exposures are expected.  Fluconazole 200  mg once daily  (atazanavir 300  mg and ritonavir 
100 mg once daily)  Atazanavir and fluconazole concentrations were not significantly modified when REYATAZ/ritonavir was co -administered with fluconazole.  No dosage adjustments are needed for fluconazole and REYATAZ.   16 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co -administration  ANTIMYCOBACTERIAL  Rifabutin 150  mg twice weekly  (atazanavir 300  mg and ritonavir

 **When compared to rifabutin 150  mg once daily alone. Total rifabutin and 
25-O- desacetyl -rifabutin AUC : ↑119% (↑78% ↑169%).  
 In previous studies, the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir was not altered by rifabutin.  When given with REYATAZ, the recommended dose of rifabutin is 150 mg 3 times per week on set days (for example Monday-Wednesday -Friday). Increased monitoring for rifabutin -associated adverse reactions including neutropenia and uveitis is warranted due to an expected increase in exposure to rifabutin. Further dosage reduction of rifabutin to 150 mg twice weekly on set days is recommended for patients in whom the 150  mg dose 3 times per week is not tolerated. It should be kept in mind that the twice weekly dosage of 150 mg may not provide an optimal exposure to rifabutin thus leading to a risk of rifamycin resistance and a treatment failure. No dose adjustment is needed for REYATAZ.  Rifampicin  Rifampicin is a strong CYP3A4 inducer and has been shown to cause a 72% decrease in atazanavir AUC which can result in virological failure and resistance development. During attempts to overcome the decreased exposure by increasing the dose of REYATAZ or other protease inhibitors with ritonavir, a high frequency of liver reactions was seen.  The combination of rifampicin and REYATAZ is contraindicated (see section  4.3). ANTIPSYCHOTICS  Quetiapine  Due to CYP3A4 inhibition by REYATAZ, concentrations of quetiapine are expected to increase.  Co-administration of quetiapine with REYATAZ is contraindicated as REYATAZ may increase quetiapine -related toxicity. Increased plasma concentrations of quetiapine may lead to coma (see section  4.3). Lurasidone  REYATAZ is expected to increase plasma levels of lurasidone due to CYP3A4 inhibition.  Co-administration of lurasidone with REYATAZ is contra indicated as this may increase lurasidone-related toxicity (see  section  4.3).  17 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co -administration  ACID REDUCING AGENTS  H2-Receptor antagonists  Without Tenofovir  In HIV -infected patients with atazanavir/ritonavir at the recommended dose 300/100  mg once daily  For patients not taking tenofovir,  if REYATAZ 300  mg/ritonavir 
100 mg and H 2-receptor antagonists are co -administered, a dose equivalent to famotidine 20 mg twice daily should not be exceeded. If a higher dose of an H 2-receptor antagonist is required (e.g., famotidine 40  mg twice daily or equivalent) an increase of the REYATAZ/ritonavir dose from 
300/100 mg to 400/100 mg can be considered.  Famotidine 20  mg twice daily  Atazanavir AUC : ↓18% (↓25% ↑1%)  Atazanavir C max: ↓20% (↓32% ↓7%)  Atazanavir C min: ↔1% (↓16% ↑18%)  Famotidine 40  mg twice daily  Atazanavir AUC : ↓23% (↓32% ↓14%)  Atazanavir C max: ↓23% (↓33% ↓12%)  Atazanavir C min: ↓20% (↓31% ↓8%)  In healthy volunteers with atazanavir/ritonavir at an increased dose of 400/100  mg once daily  Famotidine 40  mg twice daily  Atazanavir AUC : ↔3% (↓14% ↑22%)  Atazanavir C max: ↔2% (↓13% ↑8%)  Atazanavir C min: ↓14% (↓32% ↑8%)  With Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300  mg once daily (equivalent to 245  mg tenofovir disoproxil)  In HIV -infected patients with atazanavir/ritonavir at the recommended dose of 300/100  mg once daily  For patients who are taking tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, if REYATAZ/ritonavir with both tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and an H
2-receptor antagonist are co -administered, a dose increase of REYATAZ to 400  mg with 100 mg of ritonavir is recommended. A dose equivalent to famotidine 
40 mg twice daily should not be exceeded.  Famotidine 20  mg twice daily  Atazanavir AUC : ↓21% (↓34% ↓4%)*  Atazanavir C max: ↓21% (↓36% ↓4%)* Atazanavir C min: ↓19% (↓37% ↑5%)*  Famotidine 40  mg twice daily  Atazanavir AUC : ↓24% (↓36% ↓11%)*  Atazanavir C max: ↓23% (↓36% ↓8%)* Atazanavir C min: ↓25% (↓47% ↑7%)*  In HIV -infected patients with atazanavir/ritonavir at an increased dose of 400/100  mg once daily  Famotidine 20  mg twice daily  Atazanavir AUC : ↑18% (↑6.5% ↑30%)*  Atazanavir C max: ↑18% (↑6.7% ↑31%)* Atazanavir C min: ↑24% (↑10% ↑39%)*  Famotidine 40  mg twice daily  Atazanavir AUC : ↔2.3% (↓13% ↑10%)*  Atazanavir C max: ↔5% (↓17% ↑8.4%)* Atazanavir C min: ↔1.3% (↓10% ↑15)*  
 *When compared to atazanavir 300  mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 
300 mg all as a single dose with food. When compared to atazanavir 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg without tenofovir disoproxil fumarate , atazanavir concentrations are expected to be additionally decreased by about 20%.  
 The mechanism of interaction is decreased solubility of atazanavir as intra -gastric p 
 H increases with H 2-blockers.   18 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co -administration  Proton pump inhibitors  Omeprazole 40  mg once daily  (atazanavir 400  mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily)  Atazanavir (am): 2  hr after omeprazole  Atazanavir AUC : ↓61% (↓65% ↓55%)  Atazanavir C max: ↓66% (↓62% ↓49%)  Atazanavir C min: ↓65% (↓71% ↓59%)  Co-administration of REYATAZ with ritonavir and proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. If the combination is judged unavoidable, close clinical monitoring is recommended in combination with an increase in the dose of REYATAZ to 400 mg with 
100 mg of ritonavir; doses of proton pump inhibitors comparable to omeprazole 20  mg should not be exceeded (see section  4.4). Omeprazole 20  mg once daily  (atazanavir 400  mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily)  Atazanavir (am): 1  hr after omeprazole  Atazanavir AUC : ↓30% (↓43% ↓14%)* Atazanavir C max: ↓31% (↓42% ↓17%)* Atazanavir C min: ↓31% (↓46% ↓12%)* 
 *When compared to atazanavir 300  mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily.  
 The decrease in AUC, C max, and C min was not mitigated when an increased dose of REYATAZ/ritonavir (400/100  mg once daily) was temporally separated from omeprazole by 12 hours. Although not studied, similar results are expected with other proton pump inhibitors. This decrease in atazanavir exposure might negatively impact the efficacy of atazanavir. The mechanism of interaction is decreased solubility of atazanavir as intra-gastric p 
 H increases with proton pump inhibitors.  Antacids  Antacids and medicinal products containing buffers  Reduced plasma concentrations of atazanavir may be the consequence of increased gastric p 
 H if antacids, including buffered medicinal products, are administered with REYATAZ.  REYATAZ should be administered 
2 hours before or 1 hour after antacids or buffered medicinal products.  ALPHA 1 -ADRENORECEPTOR ANTAGONIST  Alfuzosin  Potential for increased alfuzosin concentrations which can result in hypotension. The mechanism of interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition by REYATAZ and/or ritonavir.  Co-administration of alfuzosin with REYATAZ is contraindicated (see section  4.3) ANTICOAGULANTS  Direct -acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs)  Apixaban  Rivaroxaban  Potential for increased apixaban and rivaroxaban concentrations which can result in a higher risk of bleeding.  
 The mechanism of interaction is inhibition of CYP3A4 /and P -gp by REYATAZ/ritonavir. 
 Ritonavir is a strong inhibitor of both CYP3A4 and P -gp. 
 REYATAZ is an inhibitor of CYP3A4. The potential inhibition of P -gp by REYATAZ is unknown and cannot be excluded.  Co-administration of apixaban or rivaroxaban and REYATAZ with ritonavir is not recommended .  19 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co -administration  Dabigatran  Potential for increased dabigatran  concentrations which can result in a higher risk of bleeding. The mechanism of interaction is P- gp inhibition.  
 Ritonavir is a strong P -gp inhibitor.  
 Potential P -gp inhibition by REYATAZ is unknown and cannot be excluded.  Co-administration of dabigatran and REYATAZ with ritonavir is not recommended.  Edoxaban  Potential for increased edoxaban  concentrations which can result in a higher risk of bleeding. The mechanism of interaction is P- gp inhibition by REYATAZ/ritonavir. 
 Ritonavir is a strong P -gp inhibitor.  
 Potential P -gp inhibition by REYATAZ is unknown and cannot be excluded.  Exercise caution when edoxaban is used with REYATAZ.  
 Please refer to the edoxaban Sm 
 PC section s 4.2 and 4.5 for appropriate edoxaban dosage recommendations for co -administration with P -gp inhibitors.  Vitamin  K antagonists  Warfarin  Co-administration with REYATAZ has the potential to increase or decrease warfarin concentrations.  It is recommended that the International Normalised Ratio (INR) be monitored carefully during treatment with REYATAZ, especially when commencing therapy.  ANTIEPILEPTICS  Carbamazepine  REYATAZ may increase plasma levels of carbamazepine due to CYP3A4 inhibition.  
 Due to carbamazepine inducing effect, a reduction in REYATAZ exposure cannot be ruled out.  Carbamazepine in combination with REYATAZ  (with or without ritonavir)  is contraindicated  due to the risk for loss of virologic response and development of resistance (s ee section 4.3) .  
 Close monitoring of the patient's virologic response should be exercised .  Phenytoin, phenobarbital  Ritonavir may decrease plasma levels of phenytoin and/or phenobarbital due to CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 induction.  
 Due to phenytoin/phenobarbital inducing effect, a reduction in REYATAZ exposure cannot be ruled out.  Phenobarbital and phenytoin in combination with REYATAZ  (with or without ritonavir ), are contraindicated , due to the risk for loss of virologic response and development of resistance. ( see section 4.3)  
 Close monitoring of patient's virologic response should be exercised.   Lamotrigine  Co-administration of lamotrigine and REYATAZ/ritonavir may decrease lamotrigine plasma concentrations due to UGT1A4 induction.  Lamotrigine should be used with caution in combination with REYATAZ/ritonavir. 
 If necessary, monitor lamotrigine concentrations and adjust the dose accordingly.   20 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co -administration  ANTINEOPLASTICS AND IMMUNOSUPRESSANTS  Antineoplastics  Apalutamide  The mechanism of interaction is CYP3A4 induction by apalutamide  and CYP3A4 inhibition by atazanavir/ritonavir.  Co-administration with REYATAZ (with or without ritonavir) is contraindicated due to the potential for decreased atazanavir and ritonavir plasma concentration with subsequent loss of virologic response and possible resistance to the class of protease inhibitors (see section  4.3). In addition, serum concentrations of apalutamide may be increased when coadministered with atazanavir/ritonavir, resulting in the potential for serious adverse events including seizure.  Encorafenib  The mechanism of interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition by atazanavir and/or ritonavir.  Co-administration of encorafenib with REYATAZ (with or without ritonavir) is contraindicated due to the potential for loss of virologic response, development of resistance, increase in encorafenib plasma concentration and subsequent risk of serious adverse events such as QT interval prolongation  (see section 4.3) .  Ivosidenib  The mechanism of interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition by atazanavir and/or ritonavir.  Co-administration of ivosidenib with REYATAZ (with or without ritonavir) is contraindicated due to potential for  loss of virologic response,  development of resistance, increase in ivosidenib plasma concentration and subsequent risk of serious adverse events such as QT interval prolongation  (see section 4.3) .  Irinotecan  Atazanavir inhibits UGT and may interfere with the metabolism of irinotecan, resulting in increased irinotecan toxicities.  If REYATAZ is co -administered with irinotecan, patients should be closely monitored for adverse events related to irinotecan.  Immunosuppressants  Cyclosporin  Tacrolimus  Sirolimus  Concentrations of these immunosuppressants may be increased when co-administered with REYATAZ due to CYP3A4 inhibition.  More frequent therapeutic concentration monitoring of these medicinal products is recommended until plasma levels have been stabilised.  CARDIOVASCULAR AGENTS  Antiarrhythmics  Amiodarone,  Systemic lidocaine,  Quinidine  Concentrations of these antiarrhythmics may be increased when co -administered with REYATAZ. The mechanism of amiodarone or systemic lidocaine/atazanavir interaction is CYP3A inhibition. Quinidine has a narrow therapeutic window and is contraindicated due to potential inhibition of CYP3A by REYATAZ.  Caution is warranted and therapeutic concentration monitoring is recommended when available. The concomitant use of quinidine is contraindicated (see section  4.3).  21 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co -administration  Calcium channel blockers  Bepridil  REYATAZ should not be used in combination with medicinal products that are substrates of CYP3A4 and have a narrow therapeutic index.  Co-administration with bepridil is contraindicated (see section  4.3) Diltiazem 180  mg once daily  (atazanavir 400  mg once daily)  Diltiazem AUC : ↑125% (↑109% ↑141%)  Diltiazem C max: ↑98% (↑78% ↑119%)  Diltiazem C min: ↑142% (↑114% ↑173%)  
 Desacetyl -diltiazem AUC : ↑165% (↑145% 
↑187%)  Desacetyl -diltiazem Cmax: ↑172% (↑144% 
↑203%)  Desacetyl -diltiazem C min: ↑121% (↑102% 
↑142%)  
 No significant effect on atazanavir concentrations was observed. There was an increase in the maximum PR interval compared to atazanavir alone. Co -administration of diltiazem and REYATAZ/ritonavir has not been studied.  
 The mechanism of diltiazem/atazanavir interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition.  An initial dose reduction of diltiazem by 50% is recommended, with subsequent titration as needed and ECG monitoring.  Verapamil  Serum concentrations of verapamil may be increased by REYATAZ due to CYP3A4 inhibition.  Caution should be exercised when verapamil is co -administered with REYATAZ.  CORTICOSTEROIDS  Dexamethasone and other corticosteroids  (all routes of administration)  Co-administration with dexamethasone or other corticosteroids that induce CYP3A may result in loss of therapeutic effect of REYATAZ and development of resistance to atazanavir and/or ritonavir. Alternative corticosteroids should be considered.  
 The mechanism of interaction is CYP3A4 induction by dexamethasone and CYP3A4 inhibition by atazanavir and/or ritonavir.  Co-administration with corticosteroids (all routes of administration) that are metabolized by CYP3A, particularly for long- term use, may increase the risk for development of systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression. The potential benefit of treatment versus the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects should be considered.  
 For co -administration of cutaneously administered corticosteroids sensitive to CYP3A inhibition, consult the Summary of Product Characteristics of the corticosteroid for condition or uses that augment its systemic absorption.   22 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co -administration  Fluticasone propionate intranasal 50 μg 4 times daily for 7  days  (ritonavir 100  mg capsules twice daily)  
 And 
 Inhaled/Nasal Corticosteroids  The fluticasone propionate plasma levels increased significantly, whereas the intrinsic cortisol levels decreased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82% -89%). Greater effects may be expected when fluticasone propionate is inhaled. Systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression have been reported in patients receiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasally administered fluticasone propionate; this could also occur with other corticosteroids metabolised via the P450 3A pathway, e.g., budesonide. The effects of high fluticasone systemic exposure on ritonavir plasma levels are yet unknown. The mechanism of interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition.  
 Concomitant use of REYATAZ (with or without ritonavir) and other Inhaled/Nasal Corticosteroids is expected to produce the same effects. Co-administration of REYATAZ/ritonavir and these glucocorticoids metabolised by CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section  4.4).  A dose reduction of the glucocorticoid should be considered with close monitoring of local and systemic effects or a switch to a glucocorticoid, which is not a substrate for CYP3A4 (e.g., beclomethasone). Moreover, in case of withdrawal of glucocorticoids, progressive dose reduction may have to be performed over a longer period.  
 Concomitant use of Inhaled/Nasal Corticosteroids and REYATAZ (with or without ritonavir) may increase plasma concentrations of Inhaled/Nasal corticosteroids. Use with caution. Consider alternatives to Inhaled/Nasal Corticosteroids, particularly for long -term use.  ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION  PDE5 Inhibitors  Sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil  Sildenafil, tadalafil , and vardenafil are metabolised by CYP3A4. Co-administration with REYATAZ may result in increased concentrations of the PDE5 inhibitor and an increase in PDE5-associated adverse events, including hypotension, visual changes, and priapism. The mechanism of this interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition.  Patients should be warned about these possible side effects when using PDE5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction with REYATAZ (see section  4.4). Also see PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION in this table for further information regarding co -administration of REYATAZ with sildenafil.  GONADOTROPIN -RELEASING HORMONE (Gn 
 RH) RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS  Elagolix  The mechanism of interaction is anticipated increase in elagolix  exposure in the presence of CYP3A4 inhibition by atazanavir and/or ritonavir.
 Concomitant use of elagolix 
200 mg twice daily with REYATAZ (with or without ritonavir) for more than 1  month is not recommended due to the potential risk of adverse events such as bone loss and hepatic transaminase elevations. Limit concomitant use of elagolix 150 mg once daily with REYATAZ (with or without ritonavir) to 6  months.   23 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co -administration  KINASE INHIBITORS  Fostamatinib  The mechanism of interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition by atazanavir and/or ritonavir.  Concomitant use of fostamatinib with REYATAZ (with or without ritonavir) may increase the plasma concentration of R406, the active metabolite of fostamatinib. Monitor for toxicities of R406 exposure resulting in dose -related adverse events such as hepatotoxicity and neutropenia. Fostamatinib dose reduction may be required.  HERBAL PRODUCTS  St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum)  Concomitant use of St. John's wort with REYATAZ may be expected to result in significant reduction in plasma levels of atazanavir. This effect may be due to an induction of CYP3A4. There is a risk of loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance (see  section  4.3). Co-administration of REYATAZ with products containing St. John's wort is contraindicated.  HORMONAL CONTRACEPTIVES  Ethinyloestradiol 25  μg + norgestimate  (atazanavir 300  mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily)  Ethinyloestradiol AUC : ↓19% (↓25% 
↓13%)  Ethinyloestradiol C max: ↓16% (↓26% ↓5%)  Ethinyloestradiol C min: ↓37% (↓45% 
↓29%)  
 Norgestimate AUC : ↑85% (↑67% ↑105%)  Norgestimate C max: ↑68% (↑51% ↑88%)  Norgestimate C min: ↑102% (↑77% ↑131%)  
 While the concentration of ethinyloestradiol was increased with atazanavir given alone, due to both UGT and CYP3A4 inhibition by atazanavir, the net effect of atazanavir/ritonavir is a decrease in ethinyloestradiol levels because of the inducing effect of ritonavir.  
 The increase in progestin exposure may lead to related side -effects (e.g., insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, acne and spotting), thus possibly affecting the compliance.  If an oral contraceptive is administered with REYATAZ/ritonavir, it is recommended that the oral contraceptive contain at least 30  μg of ethinyloestradiol and that the patient be reminded of strict compliance with this contraceptive dosing regimen. Co- administration of REYATAZ/ritonavir with other hormonal contraceptives or oral contraceptives containing progestogens other than norgestimate has not been studied, and therefore should be avoided. An alternate reliable method of contraception is recommended.   24 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co -administration  Ethinyloestradiol 35  μg + norethindrone  (atazanavir 400  mg once daily)  Ethinyloestradiol AUC : ↑48% (↑31% 
↑68%)  Ethinyloestradiol C max: ↑15% (↓1% ↑32%)  Ethinyloestradiol C min: ↑91% (↑57% 
↑133%)  
 Norethindrone AUC : ↑110% (↑68% 
↑162%)  Norethindrone C max: ↑67% (↑42% ↑196%)  Norethindrone C min: ↑262% (↑157% 
↑409%)  
 The increase in progestin exposure may lead to related side  effects (e.g., insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, acne and spotting), thus possibly affecting the compliance.  LIPID -MODIFYING AGENTS  HMG -Co 
 A reductase inhibitors  Simvastatin  Lovastatin  Simvastatin and lovastatin are highly dependent on CYP3A4 for their metabolism and co -administration with REYATAZ may result in increased concentrations.  Co-administration of simvastatin or lovastatin with REYATAZ is contraindicated due to an increased risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis (see  section  4.3). Atorvastatin  The risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis may also be increased with atorvastatin, which is also metabolised by CYP3A4.  Co-administration of atorvastatin with REYATAZ is not recommended. If the use of atorvastatin is considered strictly necessary, the lowest possible dose of atorvastatin should be administered with careful safety monitoring (see  section  4.4). Pravastatin  Fluvastatin  Although not studied, there is a potential for an increase in pravastatin or fluvastatin exposure when co -administered with protease inhibitors. Pravastatin is not metabolised by CYP3A4. Fluvastatin is partially metabolised by CYP2C9.  Caution should be exercised.  Other lipid -modifying agents  Lomitapide  Lomitapide  is highly dependent on CYP3A4 for metabolism and co-administration with REYATAZ with ritonavir may result in increased concentrations.  Co-administration of lomitapide and REYATAZ with ritonavir is contraindicated due to a potential risk of markedly increased transaminase levels and hepatotoxicity (see section  4.3). INHALED BETA AGONISTS  Salmeterol  Co-administration with REYATAZ may result in increased concentrations of salmeterol and an increase in salmeterol -associated adverse events.  
 The mechanism of interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition by atazanavir and/or ritonavir.  Co-administration of salmeterol with REYATAZ is not recommended (see section  4.4).  25 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co -administration  OPIOIDS  Buprenorphine, once daily, stable maintenance dose  (atazanavir 300  mg once daily with ritonavir 100 mg once daily)  Buprenorphine AUC: ↑67%  Buprenorphine C max: ↑37%  Buprenorphine C min: ↑69%  
 Norbuprenorphine AUC: ↑105%  Norbuprenorphine C max: ↑61%  Norbuprenorphine C min: ↑101%  
 The mechanism of interaction is CYP3A4 and UGT1A1 inhibition.  Concentrations of atazanavir (when given with ritonavir) were not significantly affected.  Co-administration with REYATAZ with ritonavir warrants clinical monitoring for sedation and cognitive effects. A dose reduction of buprenorphine may be considered.  Methadone, stable maintenance dose  (atazanavir 400  mg once daily)  No significant effect on methadone concentrations was observed. Given that low dose ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) has been shown to have no significant effect on methadone concentrations, no interaction is expected if methadone is co -administered with REYATAZ, based on these data.  No dosage adjustment is necessary if methadone is co -administered with REYATAZ.  PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION  PDE5 Inhibitors  Sildenafil  Co-administration with REYATAZ may result in increased concentrations of the PDE5 inhibitor and an increase in PDE5-inhibitor -associated adverse events.  
 The mechanism of interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition by atazanavir and/or ritonavir.  A safe and effective dose in combination with REYATAZ has not been established for sildenafil when used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension. Sildenafil, when used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, is contraindicated (see  section  4.3). SEDATIVES  Benzodiazepines  Midazolam  Triazolam  Midazolam and triazolam are extensively metabolised by CYP3A4. Co-administration with REYATAZ may cause a large increase in the concentration of these benzodiazepines. No drug interaction study has been performed for the co -administration of REYATAZ with benzodiazepines. Based on data for other CYP3A4 inhibitors, plasma concentrations of midazolam are expected to be significantly higher when midazolam is given orally. Data from concomitant use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors suggest a possible 3-4- fold increase in midazolam plasma levels.  Co-administration of REYATAZ with triazolam or orally administered midazolam is contraindicated (see section  4.3), whereas caution should be used with co -administration of REYATAZ and parenteral midazolam. If REYATAZ is co -administered with parenteral midazolam, it should be done in an intensive care unit (ICU) or similar setting which ensures close clinical monitoring and appropriate medical management in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation. Dosage adjustment for midazolam should be considered, especially if more than a single dose of midazolam is administered.  
  26 In case of withdrawal of ritonavir from the recommended atazanavir-boosted regimen (see section  4.4) The same recommendations for drug interactions would apply except:  that co -administration is not recommended with tenofovir, proton pump inhibitors, and buprenorphine and contraindicated with carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital.  
 that co -administration with famotidine is not recommended but if required, atazanavir without ritonavir should be administered either 2  hours after famotidine or 12 hours before. No single dose of famotidine should exceed 20 mg, and the total daily dose of famotidine should not exceed 40 mg. 
 the need to consider that : 
 co-administration of apixaban, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban and REYATAZ without ritonavir may affect apixaban, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban concentrations 
 co-administration of voriconazole and REYATAZ without ritonavir may affect atazanavir concentrations  
 co-administration of fluticasone and REYATAZ without ritonavir may increase fluticasone concentrations relative to fluticasone given alone  
 if an oral contraceptive is administered with REYATAZ without ritonavir, it is recommended that the oral contraceptive contain no more than 30 μ g of ethinyloestradiol  
 no dose adjustment of lamotrigine is required 
 Paediatric population Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.
