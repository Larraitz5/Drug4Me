4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction   
 Pharmacokinetic interactions 
 No interaction studies have been perform ed. Sotrovimab is not renally excreted or metaboli sed by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes; therefore, interactions with medicinal products that are renally excreted or that are substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of CYP  enzymes are unlikely.   
 Pharmacodynamic interactions  
 In vitro  pharmacodynamic studies showed no antagonism between sotrovimab and remdesivir or bamlanivimab .
