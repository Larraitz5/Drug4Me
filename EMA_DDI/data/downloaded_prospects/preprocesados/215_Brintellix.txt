4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 Vortioxetine is extensively metabolised in the liver ,primarily through oxidation catalysed by CYP2D6and to a minor extent CYP3A4/5 and CYP2C9 (see section 5.2).Poten tial for other medicinal products to affect vortioxetine 
 Irreversible non -selective MAOIs 
 Due to the risk of serotonin syndrome, vortioxetine is contraindicated in any combination withirreversible non -selective MAOIs. Vortioxetine must not be initiated f or at least 14 days after discontinuation of treatment with an irreversible non -selective MAOI. Vortioxetine must be discontinued for at least 14 days before starting treatment with an irreversible non -selective MAOI (see section 4.3).Reversible, selecti ve MAO -A inhibitor (moclobemide)The combination of vortioxetine with a reversible and selective MAO -A inhibitor, such asmoclobemide, is contraindicated (see section 4.3). If the combination proves necessary, the added medicinal product should be given wi th minimum dosage and under c loseclinical monitoring for serotonin s 
 Syndrome (see section 4.4).Reversible, non -selective MAOI (linezolid)Thecombination of vortioxetine with a weak reversible and non -selective MAOI , such as the antibiotic linezolid, iscontraindicated (see section 4.3). If the combination proves necessary, the added medicinal product should be given with minimum dosage and under closeclinical monitoring for serotonin syndrome (see section 4.4).Irreversible, selective MAO -B inhibitor (selegiline, rasagiline)Although a lower risk of serotonin syndrome is expected with selective MAO -B inhibitors than with MAO -A inhibitors, the combination of vortioxetine with irreversible MAO -B inhibitors, such as selegiline or rasagiline should be admi nistered with caution. Close monitoring for serotonin syndrome is necessary if used concomitantly (see section 4.4).Serotonergic medicinal products 
 Co-administration of medicinal product swith serotonergic effect e.g.opioids (including tramadol )and triptans (including sumatriptan )may lead to serotonin syndrome (see section 4.4).St. John’s wort 
 Concomitant use of antidepressants with serotonergic effect and herbal remedies containing St. John ’swort (Hypericum perforatum ) may result in a higher incidence of adverse reactions including Serotonin Syndrome (see section 4.4).Medicinal products lowering the seizure threshold 
 Antidepressants with serotonergic effect can lower the seizure threshold. Caution is advised whenconcomitantly using other medici nal products capable of lowering the seizure threshold [e.g.,antidepressants (tricyclics, SSRIs, SNRIs), neuroleptics (phenothiazines, thioxanthenes and butyrophenones), mefloquine , bupropion ,tramadol ](see section 4.4).ECT (electroconvulsive therapy)There is no clinical experience with concurrent administration of vortioxetine and ECT, therefore caution is advisable.v.
77.0REG_000286837CYP2D6 inhibitors 
 The exposure to vortioxetine increased 2.3 -fold for area under the curve (AUC) when vortioxetine 
10mg/day was co -administered with bupropion (a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor 150 mgtwice daily )for 
14 days in healthy subjects. Co-administration resulted in a higher incidence of adverse reactions when bupropion was added to vortioxetine than when vortioxetine was added to bupr opion. Depending on individual patient response, a lower dose of vortioxetine may be considered if strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g. ,bupropion , quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine ) isadded to vortioxetine treatment (see section 4.2).CYP3A4 inhibitors and CYP 2C9,and CYP2C19 inhibitors 
 When vortioxetine was co -administered following 6 days of ketoconazole 400 mg/day (a CYP3A4/5 and P -glycoprotein inhibitor) or following 6 days of fluconazole 200 mg/day (a CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4/5 inhibitor) in healthy sub jects, a 1.3 -foldand 1.5 -foldincrease , respectively ,in vortioxetine AUC was observed. No dose adjustment is needed.No inhibitory effect of 40 mg single -dose omeprazole (CYP2C19 inhibitor) was observed on the multiple -dose pharmacokinetics of vortioxet ine in healthy subjects.Interactions in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers 
 Co-administration of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (such as itraconazol, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin , nefazodone, conivaptan and many of the HIV protease inhibitors) and inhib itors of CYP2C9 (such as fluconazole and amiodarone) to CYP2D6 poor metabolisers (see section 5.2) has not been investigated specifically, but it is anticipated that it will lead to a more marked increased exposure of vortioxetine in these patients as comp aredto the moderate effect described above.Depending on individual patient response, a lower dose of vortioxetine may be considered if a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 or CYP2C9 is co -administered in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers .Cytochrome P450 inducers 
 When a single dose of 20 mgvortioxetine was co -administered following 10 days of rifampicin 
600mg/day (a broad inducer of CYP isozymes) in healthy subjects, a 72% decrease in AUC of vortioxetine was observed. Depending on individual patient response, a dose ad justment may be considered if abroad cytochrome P450 inducer (e.g. ,rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin) is added to vortioxetine treatment (see section 4.2).Alcohol 
 No effect on the pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine or ethanol and no significant impair ment, relative to placebo, in cognitive function w ereobserved when vortioxetine in a single dose of 20 mgor 40 mgwas co -administered with a single dose of ethanol (0.6 g/kg) in healthy subjects. However, alcohol intake is not advisable during antidepres santtreatment.Acetylsalicyli cacid 
 No effect of multiple doses of acetyl salicyl ic acid 150mg/day on the multiple -dose pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine was observed in healthy subjects.Potential for vortioxetine to affect other medicinal products 
 Anticoagulants and antiplatelet medicinal products 
 No significant effects, relative to placebo, were observed in INR, prothrombin or plasma R-/S-warfarin values following co -administration of multiple dose sofvortioxetine with stable doses of warfarin in hea lthysubjects. Also, no significant inhibitory effect, relative to placebo, on platelet aggregation or pharmacokinetics of a cetylsalicylic acid or salicylic acid was observed whenacetylsalicylic acid 150mg/day was co -administered following multiple doses of vortioxetine administration in healthy subjects. However, caution should be exercised when vortioxetine is combined with oral anticoagulants or antiplatelet medicinal products or medicines used for pain relief(e.g. acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) or NSAIDs ), due to a potential increased risk of bleeding attributable to a pharmacodynamic interaction (see section 4.4).v.
77.0REG_000286838Cytochrome P450 substrates 
 In vitro, vortioxetine did not show any relevant potential for inhibition or induction of cytochrome P450isozymes (see section 5.2).Following multiple doses of vortioxetine ,no inhibitory effect was observed in healthy subjects for the cytochrome P450 isozymes CYP2C19 (omeprazole, diazepam), CYP3A4/5 (ethinyl estradiol , midazolam ), CYP2 B6 (bupropion) ,CYP 2C9 (tolbu tamide, S-warfarin ), CYP1A2 (caffeine) or CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan).No pharmacodynam ic interactions were observed. N o significant impairment, relative to placebo, in cognitive function was observed for vortioxetine following co -administration w ith a single 10mgdose of diazepam. N o significant effects, relative to placebo, were observed in the levels of sex hormones following co -administration of vortioxetine with a combined oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradio l 
30µg/ levonorgestrel 150 µg) .Lithium, t ryptophan 
 No clinically relevant effect was observed during steady -state lithium exposure following co -administration with multiple doses of vortioxetine in healthy subjects. However, there have been reports of enhanced effects when antidepressan ts with se rotonergic effect have been given together with lithium or tryptophan ;therefore ,concomitant use of vortioxetine with these medicinal products should be undertaken with caution.Interference with urine drug screens 
 There have been reports of fa lse positi ve results in urine enzyme immunoassays for methadone in patients who have taken vortioxetine. Caution should be exercised in the interpretation of positive urine drug screen results, and confirmation by an alternative analytical technique (e.g.,chromatog raphic methods) should be considered.
