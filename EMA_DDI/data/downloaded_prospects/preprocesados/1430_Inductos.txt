4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No interaction studies have been pe rformed.  
 As dibotermin alfa is a protein and has not been identified in the general circulation, it is an unlikely candidate for pharmacokinetic drug- drug interactions.  
 In acute tibia fracture clinical trials, more Induct 
 Os patients receiving concomitan t NSAIDs for 14 consecutive days experienced mild or moderate adverse events related to wound healing (e.g., wound drainage) than Induct 
 Os patients not taking NSAIDs. Although patient outcome was not affected, an interaction between NSAIDs and Induct 
 Os can not be excluded.  
 Information from clinical studies in acute tibia fractures indicated that the use of Induct 
 Os in patients receiving glucocorticoids was not associated with any apparent adverse reactions. In non-clinical studies, concurrent administration of glucocorticoids depressed bone repair (measured as a % change from control), but the effects of Induct 
 Os were not altered.  
 In an in vitro  study , dibotermin alfa was shown to bind to fibrin- based haemostatic agents or sealants. The use of these produc ts in close proximity to Induct 
 Os is not recommended as this may lead to bone formation at the site of implant of the fibrin -based haemostatic agent or sealant (see section 4.2).
