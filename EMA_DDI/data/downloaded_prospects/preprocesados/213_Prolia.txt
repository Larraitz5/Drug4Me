4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 In an interaction  study, denosumab did not affect the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, which is metaboli sed by cytochrome P450  3A4 (CYP3A4). This indicates that denosumab should not alter the pharmacokinetics of medicinal products  metaboli sed by CYP3A4.  
 There are no clinical data on the co -administration of de nosumab and hormone replacement therapy (oestrogen), however the potential for a pharmacodynamic interaction is considered to be low.  
 In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of denosumab were not altered by prev ious alendronate therapy, based on data from a transition study (alendronate to denosumab).
