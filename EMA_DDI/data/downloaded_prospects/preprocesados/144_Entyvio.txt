4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No interaction studies have been performed. 
 Vedolizumab has been studied in adult ulcerative colitis and Crohnâ€™s disease patients with concomitant administration of corticosteroids, immunomodulators (azathioprine, 6 -mercaptopurine, and methotrexate), and aminosalicylates. Population pharmacokinetic analyses suggest that co-administration of such agents did not have a clinically meaningful effect on vedolizumab pharmacokinetics.   In adult patients with pouchitis, vedolizumab has been co-administered  with antibiotics  (see section  5.1). The pharmacokinetics of vedolizumab in patients with pouchitis has not been studied (see section  5.2).  
 The effect of vedolizumab on the pharmacokinetics of commonly co- administered medicinal compounds has not been studied.  
 Vaccinations  
 Live vaccines, in particular live oral vaccines, should be used with caution concurrently with vedolizumab (see section  4.4).
