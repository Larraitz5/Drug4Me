4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 No interaction studies have been performed.  Sirolimus is extensively metabolis ed by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme, and it is a substrate for the multidrug efflux pump P -glycoprotein (P -gp). In addition, sirolimus has been shown to inhibit human liver microsomal cytochrome P450 CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5 in vitro . In the light of the low systemic exposure after topical administration it is not expected that clinical relevant interactions will occur, but Hyftor  should be used with caution in patients  taking respective concomitant medicinal products . Potential adverse reactions should be monitored and in case observed , treatment should be interrupted.  
 Except for sunscreens, n o other topical treatments should be used on the facial angiofibroma lesions while treatment is ongoing.  
 5 Vaccination  
 During treatment with Hyftor, vaccinations may be less effective. Vaccination with li ve vaccines should be avoided during treatment.  
 Oral contraceptives 
 No interactions studies with Hyftor and oral contraceptives have been performed. Low systemic exposure to sirolimus during topical treatment with Hyftor makes pharmacokinetic drug interactions unlikely. T he possibility of changes in the pharmacokinetics that might affect the efficacy of the oral contraceptive during long-term treatment with Hyftor cannot be fully excluded.  For this reason , patients should be advi sed to use non- hormonal contraceptive measures during treatment.
