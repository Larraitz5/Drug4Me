4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 As Epclusa contains sofosbuvir  and velpatasvir , any interactions that have  been identified with these  active substances individually may occur with Epclusa . 
 Potential for Epclusa to affect other medicinal products  
 Velpatasvir is an inhibitor of drug transporter P -gp, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion- trans porting polypeptide ( OATP ) 1B1 and OATP1B3. Co -administration of Epclusa with medicinal products that are substrates of these transporters  may increase the exposure of such medicinal products. See Table  4 for examples of interactions with sensitive substra tes of P -gp (digoxin), BCRP (rosuvastatin), and OATP (pravastatin).  
 Potential for other medicinal products to affect Epclusa  
 Sofosbuvir and velpatasvir are substrates of drug transporter s P-gp and BCRP. Velpatasvir is also a substrate of drug transporter OATP1B. In  vitro,  slow metabolic turnover of velpatasvir by CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 was observed. Medicinal products that are strong inducers of P -gp and/or strong inducers of CYP2B6, CYP2C8, or CYP3A4 (e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin, rifampicin, rifabutin and St. John’s wort)  may decrease plasma concentrations of sofosbuvir or velpatasvir leading to reduced therapeutic effect of sofosbuvir /velpatasvir . The use of such medicinal 7 products with Epclusa  is contraindicated (see section  4.3). Medicinal products that are moderate P-gp inducers and/or moderate CYP inducers (e.g. efavirenz,  modafinil , oxcarbazepine or rifapentine ) may decrease sofosbuvir or velpatasvir plasma concentratio n leading to reduced therapeutic effect of Epclusa . Co-administration with such medicinal products is not recommended with Epclusa  (see section  4.4). Co-administration with medicinal products that inhibit P -gp or BCRP may increase sofosbuvir or velpatasvir  plasma concentrations . Medicinal products that inhibit  OATP,  CYP2B6, CYP2C8, or CYP3A4 may increase plasma concentration of velpatasvir. Clinically significant medicinal product interactions with Epclusa  mediated by P -gp, BCRP, OATP, or CYP450 inhibitors are not expected ; Epclusa  may be c o-administered with P -gp, BCRP , OATP  and CYP  inhibitors.  
 Patients treated with vitamin  K antagonists  
 As liver function may change during treatment with Epclusa, a close monitoring of International Normalised Ratio (INR) values is recommended. 
 Impact of DAA therapy on medicinal products  metabolized by the liver  
 The pharmacokinetics of medicinal products  that are metabolized by the liver (e.g. immunosuppressive medicinal products such as calcineurin inhibitors) may be impacted by changes in liver function during DAA therapy, related to clearance of HCV.  
 Interactions between Epclusa and other medicinal products  
 Table  4 provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant medicinal product interactions (where 90% confidence interval [CI] of the geometric least -squares mean [GLSM] ratio were within “↔”, extended above “↑”, or extended below “↓” the pred etermined interaction boundaries). The medicinal product interactions described are based on studies conducted with either sofosbuvir /velpatasvir  or velpatasvir  and sofosbuvir as individual agents, or are predicted medicinal product interactions that may occur with sofosbuvir /velpatasvir . The table is not all -inclusive.
