4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No interaction studies have been performed.  
 General  The possibility of interactions with medicinal products whose pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics are affected by asparaginase- induced changes in the liver function or plasma protein levels should be taken into account when administering asparaginase. Asparaginase may increase toxicity of other medicinal products through its effect on liver function.  
 6 Vincristine  Administration of asparaginase concurrently or immediately before vincristine may be associated with increased toxicity of vincristine. Asparaginase inhibits hepatic clearance of vincristine.  
 Methotrexate, cytarabine  Non-clinical data indicates that prior or concurrent administration of L -asparaginase attenuates the effect of methotrexate and cytarabine. Administration of L -asparaginase after methotrexate or cytarabine results in a synergistic effect. However, the clinical effect of sequence- dependent L-asparaginase administration on the efficacy of methotrexate and cytarabine is unknown.  
 Glucocorticoids  Administration of asparaginase with or immediately before glucocorticoids (e.g . prednisone) may change coagulation parameters, such as a decrease in fibrinogen and antithrombin III  levels.
