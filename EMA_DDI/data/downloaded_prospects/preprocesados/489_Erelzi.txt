4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 Concurrent treatment with anakinra 
 Adult patients treated with etanercept and anakinra were observed to have a higher rate of serious infection when compared with patients treated with either etanercept or anakinra alone (historical data).In addition, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult patients receiving background methotrexate, patients treated with etanercept and anakinra were observed to have a higher rate of 11serious infections (7%) and neutropenia than patients treated with etanercept (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). The combination etanercept and anakinra has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit, and is therefore not recommended.Concurrent treatment with abatacept 
 In clinical studies, concurrent administration of abatacept and etanercept resulted in increased incidences of serious adverse events. This combination has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit; such use is not recommended (see section 4.4).Concurrent treatment with sulfasalazine 
 In a clinical study of adult patients who were receiving established doses of sulfasalazine, to which etanercept was added, patients in the combination group experienced a statistically significant decrease in mean white blood cell counts in comparison to groups treated with etanercept or sulfasalazine alone. The clinical significance of this interaction is unknown. Physicians should use caution when considering combination therapy with sulfasalazine.Non-interactions 
 In clinical trials, no interactions have been observed when etanercept was administered with glucocorticoids, salicylates (except sulfasalazine), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), analgesics, or methotrexate. See section 4.4 for vaccination advice.No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed in studies with methotrexate, digoxin or warfarin.
