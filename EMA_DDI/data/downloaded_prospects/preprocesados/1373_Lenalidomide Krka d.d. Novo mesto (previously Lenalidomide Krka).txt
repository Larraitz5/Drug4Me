4.5 Interaction w ith other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 Erythropoietic agents, orother agents thatmayincrease theriskofthrombosis, such as hormonereplacement therapy, should be used withcaution in multiple myeloma patients receiving lenalidomi dewith dexamethasone (seesections 4.4and 4.8).Oral contraceptives 
 Nointeraction study hasbeen performed with oralcontraceptives. Lenalidomide isnotanenzymeinducer. Inan invitro study with human hepatocytes, lenalidomide, atvarious concentra tions testeddid notinduce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5. Therefore, induction leadingto reduced efficacy ofmedicinal products, including hormonal contraceptives, is notexpected iflenalidomide isadministered alone. However, dexamethaso neis known to bea weak to moderateinducer of 
 CYP3A4 andislikely to alsoaffect other enzymes as well astransporters. Itmaynotbe excluded thattheefficacy oforalcontraceptives maybereduced during treatment. Effective measuresto avoid pregnanc ymust betaken (seesections 4.4and4.6).Warfarin 
 Co-administration ofmultiple 10mgdoses oflenalidomide had no effect on thesingle dosepharmacokinetics of 
 R-and S-warfarin. Co-administration ofasingle 25mgdose of warfarin hadnoeffect on thepharmacokinetics oflenalidomide. However, itis notknown whether thereisaninteraction during clinical use(concomitant treatment with dexamethasone). Dexamethasone is a weakto moderate enzyme inducer anditseffect onwarfarin isunknown. Close monitoring ofwarfarinconcentration is advised during thetreatment.Digoxin 
 Concomitant administration with lenalidomide 10mg once daily increased theplasma exposure ofdigoxin (0.5mg,single dose) by14% witha 90% CI(confidence interval)[0.52% -28.2%]. Itis notknown whether theeffect willbe different intheclinical use(higher lenalidomide doses andconcomitant treatment with dexamethasone). Therefore, monitoring ofthedigoxin concentration isadvised during lenalidomide treatment.Statins 
 There isan increased riskofrhabdomyolysis when statins areadministered with lenalidomide, whichmaybe simply additive. Enhanced clinical andlaboratory monitoring is warranted notably during thefirstweeks oftreatment.Dexamethasone 
 Co-administrat ionofsingle ormultiple doses ofdexa methasone (40mgonce daily) hasno clinicallyrelevant effect on themultiple dose pharmacokinetics oflenalidomide (25mgonce daily).Interactions with P -glycoprotein (P-gp)inhibitors 
 In vitro,lenalidomide is asubstrate of 
 P-gp,butisnota P-gpinhibitor. Co-administration ofmultipledoses ofthe strong P-gpinhibitor quinidine (600 mg,twice daily) orthe moderate P-gpinhibitor/substrate temsirolimus (25mg)has no clinically relevant effect onthepharmac okinetics oflenalidomide (25mg).Co-administration oflenalidomide does notalter thepharmacokinetics oftemsirolimus.
