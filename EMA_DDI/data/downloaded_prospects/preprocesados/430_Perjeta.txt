4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions were observed between pertuzumab and trastuzumab, or between pertuzumab and docetaxel in a sub -study of 37 patients in the randomised, pivotal trial CLEOPATRA  in metastatic breast cancer . In addition, in the population PK  analysis, no evidence of a drug- drug interaction has been shown between pertuzumab and trastuzumab or  between pertuzumab and docetaxel . This absence of drug -drug interaction was confirmed by pharmacokinetic data from the NEOSPHERE and APHINITY studies . 
 Five studies evaluated the effects of pertuzumab on the PK of co- administered cytotoxic agents, docetaxel, paclitaxel, gemcitabine, capecitabine, carboplatin and erlotinib. There was no evidence of any PK interaction between pertuzumab and any of these agents. The PK of pertuzumab in these studies was  comparable to those observed in single -agent studies.
