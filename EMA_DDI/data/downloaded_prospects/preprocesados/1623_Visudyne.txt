4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 No interaction studies have been performed  in humans . 
 Other photosensiti sing agents  
 It is possible that concomitant use of other photosensitising medicinal products  (e.g. tetracyclines, sulphonamides, phenothiazines, sulfonylurea, hypoglyc aemic medicinal products , thiazide diuretics, and griseofulvin) could increase the potential for photosensitivity reactions . Caution should therefore be exercised when using Visudyne concomitantly with other photosensitising medicinal products  (see 
“Photosensitivity and exposure to light ” under  section  4.4). 
 Agents which  increase verteporfin uptake in the vascular endothelium 
 Agents such as calcium channel blockers, polymixin B, and radiation therapy are known to alter the vascular endothelium. Based on theoretical data and despite the lack  of clinical evidence these age nts might  result in enhanced verteporfin tissue-uptake when used concurrently.  
 Free radical scavengers  
 Although there is no clinical evidence, theoretical data  suggest that  antioxidants (e.g. beta -carotene) or medicinal products  which  scavenge free radicals (e.g. dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), f ormate, mannitol or alcohol) might  quench the activated oxygen species generated by verteporfin, resulting in decreased verteporfin activity.  
 Medicinal products which antagonise blood vessel occlusion 
 Since blood vess el occlusion is the major mechanism of verteporfin action, there is a theoretical possibility that agents such as vasodilators and those which diminish clotting and platelet aggregation (e.g. thromboxane A2 inhibitors) can antagoni se the action of vertepor fin.
