4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 Plasma protein binding 
 Pram ipexole is bound to plasma proteins to a very low (<20%) extent, and little biotransf ormation is seen in man. Therefore, interactions with other medicinal products affecting plasma protein binding or elimination by biotransformation are unlikely. As anticholinergics are mainly eliminated by biotransformation, the potential for an interacti on is limited, although an interaction with anticholinergics has not been investigated. There is no pharmacokinetic interaction with selegiline and levodopa.Inhibitors/competitors of active renal elimination pathway 
 Cimetidine reduced the renal clearance of pram ipexole by approximately 34%, presumably by inhibition of the cationic secretory transport system of the renal tubules. Therefore, medicinal products that are inhibitors of this active renal elimination pathway or are eliminated by this pathway, su ch as cimetidine,amantadine mexiletine, zidovudine, cisplatin, quinine, and procainamide, may interact with pram ipexole resulting in reduced clearance of pramipexole. Reduction of the pramipexole dose should be considered when these medicinal products are administered concomitantly with Oprymea .Combination with levodopa 
 When Oprymea is given in combination with levodopa, it is recommended that the dos e of l evodopa is reduced and the dos e of other anti -parkinsonian medicinal products is kept constant while increasing the dose of Oprymea.Because of possible additive effects, caution should be advised when patients are taking other sedating medicinal products or alcohol in combination with pramipexole (see section s4.4, 4.7 and 4.8) .Antipsychotic medicina l products 
 Co-administration of antipsychotic medicinal products with pramipexole should be avoided (see section 4.4), e.g. if antagonistic effects can be expected.
