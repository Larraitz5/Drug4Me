4.5 Interaction with other medicinal pr oducts and other fo rms of interaction  
 Since pregabalin is predominantly excreted uncha nged in the urine, underg oes negligible metabolism in humans (< 2% of a dose r ecovered in urine as metabolites), does not inhibit drug metabolism in vitro , and is not bound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely to produce, or be subject to, pharmacokinetic interactions.  In vivo  studies and population ph armacokinetic analysis Accordingly, in in vivo  studies no clinically re levant pharmacokinetic inte ractions were observed between pregabalin and phenytoin, carbamazepine, valp roic acid, lamotrigine, gabapentin, lorazepam, oxycodone or ethanol. Population pharmacokinetic analys is indicated that oral antidiabetics, diuretics, insulin, phenobarbital, tiaga bine and topiramate had no clinically significan t effect on pregabalin clearance. 
 Oral contraceptives, norethisterone and/or ethinyl oestradiol Co-administration of pregabalin with the oral contraceptives norethisterone and/or ethinyl oestradiol does not influence the steady-state pharmacokinetics of either substance. 
 Central nervous system infl uencing medical products Pregabalin may potentiate the effects of ethanol and lorazepam. 
 In the postmarketing experience, there are reports of respiratory failure, coma and deaths in patients taking pregabalin and opioids and/or other centr al nervous system (CNS) depressant medicinal products. Pregabalin appears to be  additive in the impairment of  cognitive and gross motor function caused by oxycodone. 
 Interactions and the elderly No specific pharmacodynamic interaction studies were conducted in elderly volunteers. Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.
