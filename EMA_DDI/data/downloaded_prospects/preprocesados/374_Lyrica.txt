4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other  forms of interaction  
 Since pr egabalin is predominantly excreted unchanged in the urine, undergoes negligible metabolism in humans (<  2% of a dose recovered in urine as metabolites), does not inhibit drug metabolism in vitro , and is not bound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely to produce, o r be subject to, pharmacokinetic interactions.  
 In vivo  studies and population pharmacokinetic analysis Accordingly, in in vivo  studies no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between pregabalin  and phenytoin, carbamazepine, valpr oic acid, lamotrigi ne, gabapentin, lorazepam, oxycodone or ethanol. Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that oral antidiabetics, diuretics, insulin, phenobarbital, tiagabine and topiramate had no clinically significant effect on pregabalin cleara nce. 
 Oral contraceptives, norethisterone and/or ethinyl oestradiol  Co-administration of pregabalin with the oral contraceptives norethisterone and/or ethinyl oestradiol does not influence the steady -state pharmacokinetics of either substance.  
 Centra l nervous system influencing medical products  Pregabalin may potentiate the effects of ethanol and lorazepam.  
 In the postmarketing experience, there are reports of respiratory failure, coma and deaths in patients taking preg abalin and opioids and/or other  central nervous system (CNS) depressant medicinal products. Pregabalin appears to be additive in the impairment of cognitive and gross motor function caused by oxycodone. 
 Interactions and the elderly  No specific pharmacodynamic interaction studies were c onducted in elderly volunteers. Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.
