4.5 In case of withdrawal of ritonavir from the recomm ended atazanavir boosted regimen) or in case of perceived challenging compliance.   
7  Atazanavir given without ritonavir should not be used in pregnant patients given that it could result in suboptimal exposure of particular concern for the mother infection and vertical transmission.  
 Cholelithiasis   
 Cholelithiasis has been reported in patients receiving atazanavir (see section 4.8). Some patients required hospitalization for additional management and some had complications. If signs or symptoms of  cholelithiasis occur, temporary interruption or discontinuation of treatment may be considered.  
 Chronic kidney disease  
 Chronic kidney disease in HIV -infected patients treated with atazanavir, with or without ritonavir, has been reported during postmark eting surveillance. A large prospective observational study has shown an association between an increased incidence of chronic kidney disease and cumulative exposure to atazanavir/ritonavir -containing regimen in HIV -infected patients with an initially norm al e 
 GFR. This association was observed independently of exposure to tenofovir disoproxil. Regular monitoring of the renal function of patients should be maintained throughout the treatment duration (see  section  4.8). 
 Nephrolithiasis  
 Nephrolithiasis has b een reported in patients receiving atazanavir (see section 4.8). Some patients required hospitalization for additional management and some had complications. In some cases, nephrolithiasis has been associated with acute renal failure or renal insufficiency . If signs or symptoms of nephrolithiasis occur, temporary interruption or discontinuation of treatment may be considered.  
 Immune reactivation syndrome  
 In HIV -infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or  aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis jirovecii  pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reactivation; howe ver, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment.  
 Osteonecrosis  
 Although the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe imm unosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV  disease and/or long -term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement.  
 Rash and associated syndromes  
 Rashes are usually mild -to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions that occur within the first 3 weeks of starting therapy with atazanavir.  
 Stevens -Johnson syndrome (SJS), erythema multiforme, toxic skin eruptions and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported in patients receiving atazanavir. Patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and  monitored closely for skin reactions. Atazanavir should be discontinued if severe rash develops.  
  
8 The best results in managing these events come from early diagnosis and immediate interruption of any suspect medicines. If the patient has developed SJS or  DRESS associated with the use of atazanavir, atazanavir may not be restarted.  
 Interactions with other medicinal products  
 The combination of Atazanavir Viatris  with atorvastatin is not recommended (see section 4.5).  
 Co-administration of Atazanavir Viatris with nevirapine or efavirenz is not recommended (see section 4.5).  If the co -administration of Atazanavir Viatris  with an NNRTI is required, an increase in the dose of both Atazanavir Viatris  and ritonavir to 400  mg and 200  mg, respectively, in combination with efavirenz could be considered with close clinical monitoring.  
 Atazanavir is metabolised principally by CY P3A4. Co -administration of Atazanavir Viatris  and medicinal products that induce CYP3A4 is not recommended (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).  
 PDE5 inhibitors used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction: particular caution should be used when prescribing PDE5  inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil) for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in patients receiving Atazanavir Viatris . Co-administration of Atazanavir Viatris  with these medicinal products is expected to substantially increase their concent rations and may result in PDE5 -associated adverse reactions such as hypotension, visual changes , and priapism (see section 4.5).  
 Co-administration of voriconazole and Atazanavir Viatris  with ritonavir is not recommended, unless an assessment of the benef it/risk justifies the use of voriconazole.  
 In the majority of patients, a reduction in both voriconazole and atazanavir exposures are expected. In a small number of patients without a functional CYP2C19 allele, significantly increased voriconazole exposu res are expected (see section 4.5).  
 Concomitant use of Atazanavir Viatris /ritonavir and fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised by CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression (see  section 4.5).  
 Concomitant use of salmeterol and Atazanavir Viatris  may result in increased cardiovascular adverse events associated with salmeterol. Co -administration of salmeterol and Atazanavir Viatris  is not recommended (see section 4.5).  
 The absor ption of atazanavir may be reduced in situations where gastric p 
 H is increased irrespective of cause.  
 Co-administration of Atazanavir Viatris  with proton pump inhibitors is not recommended (see section 4.5). If the combination of Atazanavir Viatris  with a proton pump inhibitor is judged unavoidable, close clinical monitoring is recommended in combination with an increase in the dose of atazanavir to 400  mg with 
100 mg of ritonavir; doses of proton pump inhibitors comparable to omeprazole 20  mg should not be exceeded.  
 Co-administration of atazanavir with other hormonal contraceptives or oral contraceptives containing progestogens other than norgestimate or norethindrone has not been studied, and therefore should be avoided (see section 4.5).  
 Paediatric population  
 Safety  Asymptomatic PR interval prolongation was more frequent in paediatric patients than adults. Asymptomatic first- and second -degree AV block was reported in paediatric patients (see section 4.8). Caution should be used with medicinal products known to induce PR prolongations. In paediatric patients with pre -existing  
9 conduction problems (second degree or higher atrioventricular or complex bundle -branch block), Atazanavir Viatris  should be used with caution and only if the bene fits exceed the risk. Cardiac monitoring is recommended based on the presence of clinical findings (e.g., bradycardia).  
 Efficacy  Atazanavir/ritonavir is not effective in viral strains harbouring multiple mutations of resistance.  
 Excipients  
 Lactose  Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency , or glucose -galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.  
 
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 When atazanavir and ritonavir are co -administered, the metabolic drug interaction profile for ritonavir may predominate because ritonavir is a more potent CYP3A4 inhibitor than atazanavir. The Summary of Product Characteristics for ritonavir must be consul ted before initiation of therapy with atazanavir  and ritonavir.  
 Atazanavir is metabolised in the liver through CYP3A4. It inhibits CYP3A4. Therefore , atazanavir  is contraindicated with medicinal products that are substrates of CYP3A4 and have a narrow th erapeutic index: quetiapine, lurasidone, alfuzosin,  astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, bepridil, triazolam, orally administered midazolam, lomitapide, and ergot alkaloids, particularly ergotamine and dihydroergotamine (see section 4.3 ). 
  Co-administration of atazanavir with grazoprevir -containing products, including elbasvir/ grazoprevir  fixed -dose combination  is contraindicated because of the increase in grazoprevir and elbasvir plasma concentrations and potential for the increase in risk of ALT elevations associated with increased grazoprevir concentrations  (see section  4.3). 
 Co-administration of atazanavir  with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir fixed -dose combination is contraindicated because of the potential increase in the ris k of ALT elevations due to a significant increase in glecapre vir and pibrentasvir plasma concentrations (see section 4.3).  
 Other interactions  
 Interactions between atazanavir and other medicinal products are listed in the table below (increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “ ↔”). If available, 90% confidence intervals (CI) are shown in parentheses. The studies presented in Tab le 2 were conducted in healthy subjects unless otherwise noted. Of importance, many studies were conducted with unboosted atazanavir, which is not the recommended regimen of atazanavir (see section 4.4).  
 If withdrawal of ritonavir is medically warranted under restrictive conditions (see section 4.4), special attention should be given to atazanavir interactions that may differ in the absence of ritonavir (see information below Table 2).

 The mechanism of interaction between atazanavir /ritonavir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir is inhibition of OATP1B, P -gp, and CYP3A.  Co-administration of atazanavir with voxilaprevir - containing products is expected to increase the concentration of voxilaprevir. Co -administration of atazanavir  with voxilaprevir -containing regimens is not recommended.

Co-administration of atazanavir with ticagrelor is not recommended due to potential increase in the antiplatelet activity of ticagrelor.  Clopidogrel  The mechanism of the interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition by atazanavir and or/ritonavir.  Co-administration with clopidogrel is not recommended due to potential reduction of the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel.  Prasugrel  The mechanism of the interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition by atazanavir and or/ritonavir.  No dose adjustment is needed when prasugrel is co-administered with atazanavir  (with or without ritonavir).  ANTI -RETROVIRALS  Protease inhibitors:  The co -administration of atazanavir/ritonavir and other protease inhibitors has not been studied but would be expected to increase exposure to other protease inhibitors. Therefore, such co-administration is not recommended.  Ritonavir 100  mg once daily  (atazanavir 300  mg once daily)  Studies conducted in HIV -infected patients.

*In a combined analysis, atazanavir 300  mg and ritonavir 100  mg (n=33) was compared to atazanavir 400  mg without ritonavir (n=28).  
 The mechanism of interaction between atazanavir and ritonavir is CYP3A4 inhibition.  Ritonavir 100  mg once daily is used as a booster of atazanavir pharmacokinetics.  Indinavir  Indinavir is associated with indirect unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia due to inhibition of UGT.  Co-administration of atazanavir and indinavir is not recommended (see section 4.4).

 Atazanavir concentrations were greatly decreased when co -administered with didanosine ( buffered tablets) and stavudine. The mechanism of interaction is a reduced solubility of atazanavir with increasing p 
 H related to the presence of anti -acid agent in didanosine buffered tablets.  
 No significant effect on didanosine and stavudine concentrat ions was observed.  Didanosine should be taken at the fasted state 
2 hours after atazanavir taken with food. The co -administration of stavudine with atazanavir is not expected to significantly alter the exposure of stavudine.

 A dose reduction of clarithromycin may result in subtherapeutic concentrations of 14 -OH clarithromycin.  
 The mechanism of the clarithromycin/atazanavir interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition.  No recommendation regarding dose reduction can be made; therefore, c aution should be exercised if atazanavir is co-administered with clarithromycin.  ANTIFUNGALS  Ketoconazole 200  mg once daily (atazanavir 400  mg once daily)  No significant effect on atazanavir concentrations was observed.  Ketoconazole and itraconazole should be used cautiously with atazanavir/ritonavir. High doses of ketoconazole and itraconazole (>200  mg/day) are not recommended.  Itraconazole  Itraconazole, like ketoconazole, is a potent inhibitor as well as a substrate of CYP3A4.  Based on data obtained with other boosted PIs and ketoconazole, where ketoconazole AUC showed a 3 -fold increase, atazanavir/ritonavir is expected to increase ketoconazole or itraconazole concentrations.

 In the majority of patients with at least one functional CYP2C19 allele, a reduction in both voriconazole and atazanavir exposures are expected.  Co-administration of voriconazole and atazanavir with ritonavir is not recommended unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of voriconazole (see section 4.4).  At the time voriconazole treatment is required, a patient’s CYP2C19 genotype should be performed if feasible.

 In a small number of patients without a functional CYP2C19 allele, significantly increased voriconazole exposures are expected.  Therefore if the combination is unavoidable, the following recommendations are made according to the CYP2C19 status:  
- in patients with at least one functional CYP2C19 allele, close clinical monitoring for a loss of both voriconazole (clinical signs) and atazanavir (virologic response) efficacy is recommended.  
- in patients without a functional CYP2C19 allele, close clinical and laboratory monitoring of voriconazole -associated adverse events is recommended  If genotyping is not feasible, full monitoring of safety and efficacy should be performed.  Fluconazole 200  mg once daily   (atazanavir 300  mg and ritonavir

  In previous studies, the pharmacokinetics of ataza navir was not altered by rifabutin.  When given with atazanavir, the recommended dose of rifabutin is 150  mg 3 times per week on set days (for example Monday -Wednesday -Friday). Increased monitoring for rifabutin -associated adverse reactions including neutr openia and uveitis is warranted due to an expected increase in exposure to rifabutin. Further dosage reduction of rifabutin to 150  mg twice weekly on set  
16 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co -administration  days is recommended for patients in whom the 
150 mg dose 3 times per week is not tolerated. It should be kept in mind that the twice weekly dosage of 150  mg may not provide an optimal exposure to rifabutin thus leading to a risk of rifamycin resistance and a treatment failure. No dose adjustment is needed for atazanavir.  Rifampicin  Rifampicin is a strong CYP3A4 inducer and has been shown to cause a 72% decrease in atazanavir AUC which can result in virological failure and resistance development. During attempts to overcome the decreased exposure by increasing the dose of atazanavir o r other protease inhibitors with ritonavir, a high frequency of liver reactions was seen.  The combination of rifampicin and atazanavir is contraindicated (see section 4.3).  ANTIPSYCHOTICS  Quetiapine  Due to CYP3A4 inhibition by atazanavir, concentrations of quetiapine are expected to increase.  Co-administration of quetiapine with atazanavir is contraindicated as atazanavir may increase quetiapine -related toxicity. Increased plasma concentrations of quetiapine may lead to coma (see section 
4.3). Lurasidone  Atazanavir is expected to increase plasma levels of lurasidone due to CYP3A4 inhibition.  Co-administration of lurasidone with atazanavir is contraindicated as this may increase lurasidone -related toxicity (see section  4.3).

When compared to atazanavir 300  mg with ritonavir 100  mg without tenofovir disoproxil fumarate , atazanavir concentrations are expected to be additionally decreased by about 20%.  
  The mechanism of interaction is decreased solubility of atazanavir as intra -gastric p 
 H increases with H 2-blockers.  Proton pump inhibitors   
18 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co -administration  Omeprazole 40  mg once daily   (atazanavir 400  mg once daily with ritonavir 100  mg once daily)  Atazanavir (am): 2 hr after omeprazole  Atazanavir AUC : ↓61% (↓65% ↓55%)  Atazanavir C max: ↓66% (↓62% ↓49%)  Atazanavir C min: ↓65% (↓71% ↓59%)  Co-administration of atazanavir with ritonavir and proton pump inhibitors is not recommended. If the combination is judged unavoidable, close clinical monitoring is recommended in combination with an increase in the dose of atazanavir to 400  mg with 100  mg of ritonavir; doses of proton pump inhibitors comparable to omeprazole 20  mg should not be exceeded (see section 4.4).  Omeprazole 20  mg once daily   (atazanavir 400  mg once daily with ritonavir 100  mg once daily)  Atazanavir (am): 1 hr after omeprazole  Atazanavir AUC : ↓30% (↓43% ↓14%)*  Atazanavir C max: ↓31% (↓42% ↓17%)*  Atazanavir C min: ↓31% (↓46% ↓12%)*  
 
*When compared to atazanavir 300  mg once daily with ritonavir 100  mg once daily.  
 The decrease in AUC, C max, and C min was not mitigated when an increased dose of atazanavir /ritonavir (400/100  mg once daily) was temporally separated from omeprazole by 
12 hours. Although not studied, similar results are expected with other proton pump inhibitors. This decrease in atazanav ir exposure might negatively impact the efficacy of atazanavir. The mechanism of interaction is decreased solubility of atazanavir as intra -gastric p 
 H increases with proton pump inhibitors.  Antacids  Antacids and medicinal products containing buffers  Reduced plasma concentrations of atazanavir may be the consequence of increased gastric p 
 H if antacids, including buffered medicinal products, are administered with atazanavir.  Atazanavir should be administered 2 hours before or 1 hour after antac ids or buffered medicinal products.  ALPHA 1 -ADRENORECEPTOR ANTAGONIST  Alfuzosin  Potential for increased alfuzosin concentrations which can result in hypotension. The mechanism of interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition by atazanavir and/or ritonavir.

 Ritonavir is a strong P -gp inhibitor.  
 Potential P -gp inhibition by atazanavir is unknown and cannot be excluded.  Exercise caution when edoxaban is used with atazanavir . 
 Please refer to the edoxaban Sm 
 PC section s 4.2 and 4.5 for appropriate edoxaban dosage recommendations for co-administration with P-gp inhibitors.  Vitamin K antagonists  Warfarin  Co-administration with atazanavir has the potential to increase or decrease warfarin concentrations.  It is recommended that the International Normalised Ratio (INR) be monitored carefully during treatment with atazanavir, especially when commencing therapy.  ANTIEPILEPTICS  Carbamazepine  Atazanavir may increase plasma levels of carbamazepine due to CYP3A4 inhibition.  Due to carbamazepine inducing effect, a reduction in atazanavir exposure cannot be ruled out.  Carbamazepine should be used with caution in combination with atazanavir. If nec essary, monitor carbamazepine serum concentrations and adjust the dose accordingly. Close monitoring of the patient's virologic response should be exercised.  Phenytoin, phenobarbital  Ritonavir may decrease plasma levels of phenytoin and/or phenobarbital due to CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 induction.  
 Phenobarbital and phenytoin should be used with caution in combination with atazanavir /ritonavir.   
20 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co -administration  Due to phenytoin/phenobarbital inducing effect, a reduction in atazanavir exposure cannot be ruled out  When atazanavi r/ritonavir is co-administered with either phenytoin or phenobarbital, a dose adjustment of phenytoin or phenobarbital may be required.  Close monitoring of patient’s virologic response should be exercised.  Lamotrigine  Co-administration of lamotrigine an d atazanavir/ritonavir may decrease lamotrigine plasma concentrations due to UGT1A4 induction.  Lamotrigine should be used with caution in combination with atazanavir/ritonavir.  If necessary, monitor lamotrigine concentrations and adjust the dose according ly.  ANTINEOPLASTICS AND IMMUNOSUPRESSANTS  Antineoplastics  Apalutamide  The mechanism of interaction is CYP3A4 induction by apalutamide and CYP3A4 inhibition by atazanavir/ritonavir.  Co-administration with atazanavir (with or without ritonavir) is contraindicated due to the potential for decreased atazanavir and ritonavir plasma concentration with subsequent loss of virologic response and possible resistance to the class of protease inhibitors (see section 
4.3). In addition, serum conc entrations of apalutamide may be increased when co -administered with atazanavir/ritonavir, resulting in the potential for serious adverse events including seizure.  Encorafenib  The mechanism of interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition by atazanavir and/or ritonavi r. Avoid co -administration of encorafenib with atazanavir (with or without ritonavir) due to potential for increase in  
21 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co -administration  encorafenib  plasma concentration and subsequent risk of serious adverse events such as QT interval prolongation. If co-administration of encorafenib with atazanavir (with or without ritonavir) cannot be avoided, modify encorafenib dose as recommended for co -administr ation with strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors in the Summary of Product Characteristics of encorafenib.  Ivosidenib  The mechanism of interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition by atazanavir and/or ritonavir.  Avoid co -administration of ivosidenib with atazanavir  (with or without ritonavir) due to potential for increase in ivosidenib plasma concentration and subsequent risk of serious adverse events such as QT interval prolongation. If co-administration of ivosidenib with atazanavir (with or without ritonavir) canno t be avoided, modify ivosidenib dose as recommended for co-administration with strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors in the Summary of Product Characteristics of ivosidenib.  Irinotecan  Atazanavir inhibits UGT and may interfere with the metabolism of irino tecan, resulting in increased irinotecan toxicities.  If atazanavir is co-administered with irinotecan, patients should be closely monitored for adverse events related to irinotecan.  Immunosuppressants   
22 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co -administration  Cyclosporin   Tacrolimus   Sirolimus   Concentrations of these immunosuppressants may be increased when co -administered with atazanavir due to CYP3A4 inhibition.  More frequent therapeutic concentration monitoring of these medicinal products is recommended until plasma levels have been stabilised.  CARDIOVASCULAR AGENTS  Antiarrhythmics  Amiodarone, Systemic lidocaine, Quinidine  Concentrations of these antiarrhythmics may be increased when co -administered with atazanavir. The mechanism of amiodarone or systemic lidocaine/atazanavir interaction is CYP3A inhibition. Quinidine has a narrow therapeutic window and is contraindicated du e to potential inhibition of CYP3A by atazanavir.  Caution is warranted and therapeutic concentration monitoring is recommended when available. The concomitant use of quinidine is contraindicated (see section 4.3).  Calcium channel blockers  Bepridil  Atazanavir should not be used in combination with medicinal products that are substrates of CYP3A4 and have a narrow therapeutic index.  Co-administration with bepridil is contraindicated (see section 4.3)  Diltiazem 180  mg once daily   (atazanavir 400  mg once daily)  Diltiazem AUC : ↑125% (↑109% ↑141%)  Diltiazem C max: ↑98% (↑78% ↑119%)  Diltiazem C min: ↑142% (↑114% ↑173%)  
 Desacetyl -diltiazem AUC : ↑165% (↑145% 
↑187%)  Desacetyl -diltiazem C max: ↑172% (↑144% 
↑203%)  Desacetyl -diltiazem C min: ↑121% (↑102% 
↑142%)  
 No significant effect on atazanavir concentrations was observed. There was an increase in th e maximum PR interval compared to atazanavir alone. Co -administration of diltiazem and atazanavir 
/ritonavir has not been studied.  
 The mechanism of diltiazem/atazanavir interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition.  An initial dose reduction of diltiazem by 50% is recommended, with subsequent titration as needed and ECG monitoring.  Verapamil  Serum concentrations of verapamil may be increased by  atazanavir due to CYP3A4 inhibition.  Caution should be exercised when verapamil is co-administered with atazanavir.   
23 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co -administration  CORTICOSTEROIDS  Dexamethasone and other corticosteroids (all routes of administration)  Co-administration with dexamethasone or other corticosteroids that induce CYP3A may result in loss of therapeutic effect of atazanavir and development of resistance to atazanavir and/or ritonavir. Alternative corticosteroids should be considered.  
 The mechani sm of interaction is CYP3A4 induction by dexamethasone and CYP3A4 inhibition by atazanavir and/or ritonavir.  Co-administration with corticosteroids (all routes of administration) that are metabolized by CYP3A, particularly for long term use, may increase the risk for development of systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression. The potential benefit of treatment versus the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects should be considered.  
 For co -administration of cutaneous ly administered corticosteroids sensitive to CYP3A inhibition, consult the Summary of Product Characteristics of the corticosteroid for condition or uses that augment its systemic absorption.  Fluticasone propionate intranasal 50  µg 4 times daily for 7 days   (ritonavir 100  mg capsules twice daily)  
 And 
 Inhaled/Nasal Corticosteroids  The fluticasone propionate plasma levels increased significantly, whereas the intrinsic cortisol levels decreased by approximately 
86% (90% confidence interval 82% - 89%). Greater effects may be expected when fluticasone propionate is inhaled. Systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression have been reported in patients receiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasally administered fluticason e propionate; this could also occur with other corticosteroids metabolised via the P450 3A pathway, e.g., budesonide. The effects of high fluticasone systemic exposure on ritonavir plasma levels are yet unknown. The mechanism of interaction is CYP3A4 inhib ition.  
 Concomitant use of atazanavir  (with or without ritonavir) and other Inhaled/Nasal Corticosteroids is expected to produce the same effects.   Co-administration of atazanavir /ritonavir and these glucocorticoids  metabolised by CYP3A4  is not recommende d unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 4.4). A dose reduction of the glucocorticoid should be considered with close monitoring of local and systemic effects or a switch to a glucocorti coid, which is not a substrate for CYP3A4 (e.g., beclomethasone). Moreover, in case of  
24 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co -administration  withdrawal of glucocorticoids, progressive dose reduction may have to be performed over a longer period.  
 Concomitant use of Inhaled/Nasal Corticosteroids and atazanavir  (with or without ritonavir) may increase plasma concentrations of Inhaled/Nasal corticosteroids. Use with caution. Consider alternatives to Inhaled/Nasal Corticosteroids, particularly for long -term use.    ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION  PDE5 Inhibitors  Sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil  Sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil are metabolised by CYP3A4. Co -administration with atazanavir may result in increased concentrations of the PDE5 inhibitor and an increase in PDE5 -associated adverse events, including hypotension, visual changes, and priapism. The mechanism of this interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition.  Patients should be warned about these possible side effects when using PDE5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction with atazanavir (see section 
4.4).  Also see PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION in this table for further information regarding co-administration of atazanavir with sildenafil.  GONADOTROPIN RELEASING HORMONE (Gn 
 RH) RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS  Elagolix  The mechanism of interaction is anticipated increase in elagolix exposure in the presence of CYP3A4 inhibition by atazanavir and/or ritonavir.  Concomitant use of elagolix 200  mg twice daily with atazanavir  (with or without ritonavir) for more than 
1 month is not recommended due to the potential risk of adverse events such as bone loss  
25 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co -administration  and hepatic transaminase elevations. Limit concomitant use of elagolix 150  mg once daily with atazanavir  (with or without ritonavir) to 6 months.  
 KINASE INHIBITORS  
 Fostamatinib   The mechanism of interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition by atazanavir and/or ritonavir.  Concomitant use of fostamatinib with atazanavir  (with or without ritonavir) may increase the plasma concentration of R406, the active metabolite of fostamatinib. Monitor for toxicities of R406 exposure resulting in dose-related adverse events such as hepatotoxicity and neutropenia. Fostamatinib dose reduction may be required.  HERBAL PRODUCTS  St. John’s wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) Concomitant use of St. John’s wort with atazanavir may be expected to result in significant reduction in plasma levels of atazanavir. This effect may be due to an induction of CYP3A4. There is a risk of loss of therapeutic effect and development of resista nce (see section 4.3).  Co-administration of atazanavir with products containing St. John’s wort is contraindicated.  HORMONAL CONTRACEPTIVES  Ethinyloestradiol 25 μg + norgestimate   (atazanavir 300  mg once daily with ritonavir 100  mg once daily)  Ethinyloestradiol AUC : ↓19% (↓25% ↓13%)  Ethinyloestradiol C max: ↓16% (↓26% ↓5%)  Ethinyloestradiol C min: ↓37% (↓45% ↓29%)  
 Norgestimate AUC : ↑85% (↑67% ↑105%)  Norgestimate C max: ↑68% (↑51% ↑88%)  Norgestimate C min: ↑102% (↑77% ↑131%)  
 While the concentration of ethinyloestradiol was increased with atazanavir given alone, due to both UGT and CYP3A4 inhibition by atazanavir, the net effect of atazanavir/ritonavir is a decrease in ethinyloestradiol levels because of the inducing effect of ritonavir.  
 If an oral contraceptive is administered with atazanavir /ritonavir, it is recommended that the oral contraceptive contain at least 30 μg of ethinyloestradiol and that the patient be reminded of strict compliance with this contraceptive dosing regimen. Co -administration of atazanavir /ritonavir with other hormonal contraceptives or oral  
26 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co -administration  The increase in progestin exposure may lead to related side -effects (e.g. , insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, acne and spotting), thus possibly affecting the compliance.  contraceptives containing progestogens other than norgestimate has not been studied, and therefore should be avoided. An alternate reliable method of contraception is recomm ended.  Ethinyloestradiol 35  µg + norethindrone  (atazanavir 400 mg once daily)  Ethinyloestradiol AUC : ↑48% (↑31% ↑68%)  Ethinyloestradiol C max: ↑15% (↓1% ↑32%)  Ethinyloestradiol C min: ↑91% (↑57% ↑133%)  
 Norethindrone AUC : ↑110% (↑68% ↑162%)  Norethindrone C max: ↑67% (↑42% ↑196%)  Norethindrone C min: ↑262% (↑157% ↑409%)  
 The increase in progestin exposure may lead to related side  effects (e.g. , insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, acne and spotting), thus possibly affecting the compliance.  LIPID MODIFYING AGENTS  HMG - Co 
 A reductase inhibitors  Simvastatin   Lovastatin  Simvastatin and lovastatin are highly dependent on CYP3A4 for their metabolism and co -administration with atazanavir may result in increased concentrations.  Co-administration of simvastatin or lovastatin with atazanavir is contraindicated due to an increased risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis (see section 4.3).  Atorvastatin  The risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis may also be increased with atorvastatin, which is also metabolised by CYP3A4.  Co-administration of atorvastatin with atazanavir is not recommended. If the use of atorvastatin is considered strictly necessary, the lowest possible dose of atorvastatin should be administered with careful safety monitoring (see section 
4.4).  Pravastatin   Fluvastatin  Although not studied, there is a potential for an increase in pravastatin or fluvastatin exposure when co -administe red with protease inhibitors. Pravastatin is not metabolised by CYP3A4. Fluvastatin is partially metabolised by CYP2C9.  Caution should be exercised.  Other lipid -modifying agents  Lomitapide  Lomitapide is highly dependent on CYP3A4 for metabolism and co -administration with atazanavir with ritonavir may result in increased concentrations.  Co-administration of lomitapide and atazanavir with ritonavir is contraindicated due to  
27 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co -administration  a potential risk of  markedly increased transaminase levels and hepatotoxicity (see section 4.3).  INHALED BETA AGONISTS  Salmeterol  Co-administration with atazanavir may result in increased concentrations of salmeterol and an increase in salmeterol - associated adverse events.  
 The mechanism of interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition by atazanavir and/or ritonavir.  Co-administration of salme terol with atazanavir is not recommended (see section 4.4).  OPIOIDS  Buprenorphine, once daily, stable maintenance dose   (atazanavir 300  mg once daily with ritonavir 100  mg once daily)  Buprenorphine AUC :↑67%  Buprenorphine C max:↑37%  Buprenorphine C min:↑69%  
 Norbuprenorphine AUC :↑105%  Norbuprenorphine C max:↑61%  Norbuprenorphine C min:↑101%  
 The mechanism of interaction is CYP3A4 and UGT1A1 inhibition.  Concentrations of atazanavir (when given with ritonavir) were not significantly a ffected.  Co-administration with atazanavir with ritonavir warrants clinical monitoring for sedation and cognitive effects. A dose reduction of buprenorphine may be considered  Methadone, stable maintenance dose   (atazanavir 400  mg once daily)  No signifi cant effect on methadone concentrations was observed. Given that low dose ritonavir (100  mg twice daily) has been shown to have no significant effect on methadone concentrations, no interaction is expected if methadone is co -administered with atazanavir, b ased on these data.  No dosage adjustment is necessary if methadone is co-administered with atazanavir.  PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION  PDE5 Inhibitors  Sildenafil  Co-administration with atazanavir may result in increased concentrations of the PDE5 inhibitor and an increase in PDE5 -inhibitor -associated adverse events.  
 The mechanism of interaction is CYP3A4 inhibition by atazanavir and/or ritonavir.  A safe and effective dose in combination with atazanavir has not been established for sildenafil whe n used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension. Sildenafil, when used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, is contraindicated (see section 4.3).  SEDATIVES  Benzodiazepines   
28 Medicinal products by therapeutic area  Interaction  Recommendations concerning co -administration  Midazolam   Triazolam  Midazolam and triazolam are extensively metabolised by CYP3A4. Co -administration with atazanavir may cause a large increase in the concentration of these benzodiazepines. No drug interaction study has been performed for the co -administration of atazanavir with benzodiazepines. Based on data for other CYP3A4 inhibitors, plasma concentrations of midazolam are expected to be significantly higher when midazolam is given orally. Data from concomitant use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors suggest a possible 3 -4-fold inc rease in midazolam plasma levels.  Co-administration of atazanavir with triazolam or orally administered midazolam is contraindicated (see section 4.3), whereas caution should be used with co -administration of atazanavir and parenteral midazolam. If atazan avir is co -administered with parenteral midazolam, it should be done in an intensive care unit (ICU) or similar setting which ensures close clinical monitoring and appropriate medical management in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation. Dosage adjustment for midazolam should be considered, especially if more than a single dose of midazolam is administered.  
 In case of withdrawal of ritonavir from the recommended atazanavir -boosted regimen (see section 4.4)  
 The same recommendations for drug drug interactions would apply except:  
- that co -administration is not recommended with tenofovir, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, proton pump inhibitors, and buprenorphine.  
- that co -administration with famotidine is not recommended but if required, atazanavir without ritonavir should be administered either 2 hours after famotidine or 12 hours before. No single dose of famotidine should exceed 20 mg, and the total daily dose of famotidine should not exceed 40 mg.  
- the need to consider that  
- co-administration of apixaban, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban and atazanavir without ritonavir may affect apixaban, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban concentrations  
- co-administration of voriconazole and atazanavir without ritonavir may affect atazanavir concentration s 
- co-administration of fluticasone and atazanavir without ritonavir may increase fluticasone concentrations relative to fluticasone given alone  
- if an oral contraceptive is administered with atazanavir without ritonavir, it is recommended that the oral cont raceptive contain no more than 30  µg of ethinyloestradiol  
- no dose adjustment of lamotrigine is required
