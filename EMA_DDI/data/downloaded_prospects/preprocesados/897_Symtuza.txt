4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 No interaction trials have been performed using Symtuza . Interactions that have been identified in studies with individual components of Symtuza ,i.e. with darunavir (in combination with low dose ritonavir) ,cobicistat, emtricitabine or tenofovir alafenamide, determine the interactions t hat may occur with Symtuza .Darunavir and cobicistat 
 Darunavir is an inhibitor of CYP3A, a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 and an inhibitor of P -gp. Cobicistat is a mechanism based inhibitor of CYP3A, and a weak CYP2D6 inhibitor. Cobicistat inhibits the transpor ters p -glycoprotein (P -gp), BCRP, MATE1, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Cobicistat is not expected to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19. Cobicistat is not expected to induce CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, UGT1A1, or P -gp (MDR1).Co-administration of Symt uzaand medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP3A or transported by P -gp, BCRP, MATE1, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 may result in increased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions (see section 4.3 or table below) .Symtuza must not be combined with medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which increased systemic exposure is associated with serious and/or life -threatening events (nar row therapeutic index).Co-administration of Symt uzaandmedicinal products that have active metabolite(s) formed by CYP3A may result in reduced plasma concentrations of these active metabolite(s) potentially leading to loss of their therapeutic effect .These interactions are described in the interaction table below .Darunavir and cobicistat are metabolised by CYP3A. Medicinal products that induce CYP3A activity would be expected to increase the clearance of darunavir and cobicistat, resulting in lowered plasma concentrations of darunavir and cobicistat ( e.g.efavirenz, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, rifampicin, rifapentine, rifabutin, St .John’s Wort )(see section 4.3 and interaction table below) .Co-administration of Symt uzaand other medicina l products that inhibit CYP3A may decrease the clearance of darunavir and cobicistat and may result in increased plasma concentrations of darunavir and cobicistat ( e.g.azole antifungal s like clotrimazole). These interactions are described in the interacti on table below.Unlike ritonavir, cobicistat is not an inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or UGT1A1. Ifswitching from ritonavir as a pharmacoenhancer to this regimen with cobicistat , caution is required during the first two weeks of treat ment with Symtuza , particularly if doses of any concomitantly administered medic inal products have been titrated or adjusted during use of ritonavir .8Emtricitabine 
 In vitro and clinical pharmacokinetic interaction studies have shown that the potential for 
 CYP -mediated interactions involving emtricitabine with other medicinal products is low.Emtricitabine did not inhibit the glucuronidation reaction of a non -specific UGT substrate in vitro . Co-administration of emtricitabine with medicinal products that a re eliminated by active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of emtricitabine, and/or the co -administered medicinal product. Medicinal products that decrease renal function may increase concentrations of emtricitabine.Tenofovir alafenamide 
 Tenof ovir alafenamide is transported by P -glycoprotein (P -gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Medicinal products that strongly affect P -gp activity and BCRP may lead to changes in tenofovir alafenamide absorption. Medicinal products that induce P -gp activity ( e.g., rifampicin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) are expected to decrease the absorption of tenofovir alafenamide, resulting in decreased plasma concentration of tenofovir alafenamide, which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of tenofovir alafenamide and development of resistance. Co -administration oftenofovir alafenamide with other medicinal products that inhibit P -gp (e.g., cobicistat, ritonavir, ciclosporin) are expected to increase the absorption and plasma concentration of te nofovir alafenamide. It is not known whether the co -administration of tenofovir alafenamide and xa nthine oxidase inhibitors (e.g. febuxostat) would increase systemic exposure to tenofovir.Tenofovir alafenamide is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C 8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 in vitro . It is not an inhibitor of CYP3A4 in vivo . Tenofovir alafenamide is a substrate of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in vitro . The distribution of tenofovir alafenamide in the body may be affected by the activity of OATP1B1 and OAT P1B3.Interaction table 
 Expected i nteractions between Symtuza with potential concomitant medici nal products are listed in Table 1below and are based on the studies conducted with the components of Symtuza , as individual agents or combined, or are potenti al interactions that may occur.Interaction trials with the components of Symtuza have only been performed in adults.The interaction profile of darunavir depends on whether ritonavir or cobicistat is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer ; therefore ,there may be different recommendations for the use of darunavir with concomitant medicine s.Refer to the prescribing information for darunavir for further information.The below list of examples of interactions is not comprehensive and therefore the label of ea ch medicinal product that is co -administered with Symtuza should be consulted for information related to the route of metabolism, interaction pathways, potential risks, and specific actions to be taken with regards to co -administration.Table 1: Interacti ons between the individual components of Symtuza and other medicinal products

If the combination is needed, the recommended dose of rifabutin is 
150mg 3 times per w eek on set days (for example Monday -Wednesday -Friday). Increased monit oring for rifabutin associated adverse reactions including neutropenia and uveitis is warranted due to an expected increase in exposure to rifabutin. Further dose reduction of rifabutin has not been studied. It should be kept in mind that the twice weekly dose of 150 mg may not provide an optimal exposure to rifabutin thus leading to a risk of rifamycin resistance and a treatment failure. Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate treatment of tuberculosis in HIV infected patients .This recommendation is different from ritonavir -boosted darunavir. Consult the Summary of Product Characteristics for darunavir for further details.ANTI -NEOPLASTICSDasatinib
