4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Concurrent  treatment with anakinra  
 Adult patients treated with Enbrel and anakinra were observed to have a higher rate of serious infection when compared with patients treated with either Enbrel or anakinra alone (historical data).  
 In addition, in a double -blind,  placebo -controlled trial in adult patients receiving background methotrexate, patients treated with Enbrel and anakinra were observed to have a higher rate of serious infections (7%) and neutropenia than patients treated with Enbrel (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). The combination Enbrel and anakinra has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit, and is therefore not recommended.  
 Concurrent treatment with abatacept  
 In clinical studies, concurrent administration of abatacept and Enbrel resulted in increased  incidences of serious adverse events. This combination has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit; such use is not recommended (see section 4.4).  
 Concurrent treatment with sulfasalazine  
 In a clinical study of adult patients who were receiving established doses of sulfasalazine, to which Enbrel was added, patients in the combination group experienced a statistically significant decrease in  
 
 
10 mean white blood cell counts in comparison to grou ps treated with Enbrel or sulfasalazine alone. The clinical significance of this interaction is unknown.  Physicians should use caution when considering combination therapy with sulfasalazine.  
 Non-interactions  
 In clinical trials, no interactions have been  observed when Enbrel was administered with glucocorticoids, salicylates (except sulfasalazine), nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), analgesics, or methotrexate. See section 4.4 for vaccination advice.  
 No clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions were observed in studies with methotrexate,  digoxin or warfarin.
