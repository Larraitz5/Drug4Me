4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of  interaction    No interaction studies have been performed for the two oral suspensions of glibenclamide (0.6 mg/m 
 L and 6 mg/m 
 L).  
 Hypoglycaemia may occur when taking other medicinal products.  Highly protein-bound medicinal products, which may also potentiate the hypoglycaemic action of glibenclamide due to glibenclamide displacement from plasma proteins, include oral anticoagulants, phenytoin, salicylates and other non-steroidal anti -inflammato ry agents.  Weakening of the blood-glucose -lowering effect and, thus, raised blood -glucose levels may occur when taking other medicinal products.  Under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta -blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter -regulation to hypoglycaemia may be reduced or absent. The symptoms of hypoglycaemia may also be milder or  absent where hypoglycaemia develops gradually or where there is autonomic neuropathy.  
 In very rare cases, an intolerance to alcohol may occur. Both acute and chronic alcohol intake, or excessive alcohol ingestion by people who drink occasionally, may attenuate the hypoglycaemic effect of glibenclamide or dangerously potentiate it by delaying its metabolic inactivation. Disulfiram -like reactions have occurred very rarely following the concomitant use of alcohol and glibenclamide.  
 Glibenclamide may increase ciclosporin plasma concentration and potentially lead to its increased toxicity. Monitoring and dose adjustment of ciclosporin are therefore recommended when both medicinal products are co -administered.  
 Colesevelam binds to glibenclamide and reduces glibenclamide absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. No interaction was observed when glibenclamide was taken at least 4 hours before colesevelam. Therefore, glibenclamide should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam.
