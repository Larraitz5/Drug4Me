 No interaction studies have been performed.  
 Immunosuppressive and cytotoxic therapies  
 Certain concomitant or recently administered medicinal products  including chemotherapy (systemic or intrathecal), anti -T-cell antibody- based therapies, extracorporeal photoph eresis or brentuximab vedotin could potentially impact the efficacy of Ebvallo . Ebvallo  should only be administered  after an adequate washout period of such agents.  
 For patients receiving chronic corticosteroid  therapy, the dose of these drugs  should be reduced as much as is clinically safe and appropriate; recommended no greater than 1 mg/kg per day  of prednisone  or equivalent. Ebvallo has not been evaluated in patients receiving corticosteroid doses greater than 1  mg/kg per day of prednisone or equivalent.  
 In clinical studies , patients received ciclosporin, tacrolimus, sirolimus  and other immunosuppress ive therapies at the lowest dose considered clinically safe and appropriate .

 CD20 -targeting antibodies  
 Because in  vitro  characteri sation data demonstrated the absence of CD20 expression on tabelecleucel , it is not expected that anti -CD20 antibody treatments will affect tabelecleucel  activity.
