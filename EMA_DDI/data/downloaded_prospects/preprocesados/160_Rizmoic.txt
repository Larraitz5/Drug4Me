4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  Effects of other medicinal product s on naldemedine  Naldemedine is primarily metabolised by CYP3A with some contribution from UGT1A3 and is a substrate of P -glycoprotein (P -gp) (see section  5.2). Interactions with CYP3A inhibitors  Itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, i ncreased exposure to naldemedine 2.9  fold that may result in an increased risk of adverse reactions.  5 Concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors  such as grapefruit juice, itraconazole, ketoconazole, ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin and clarit hromycin should be avoided.  If use with strong CYP3A inhibitors is unavoidable, monitor for adverse reactions (see section  4.4). Concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inhibitors such as fluconazole, may increase the plasma concentration of naldemedine. If used  with moderate CYP3A inhibitors, monitor for adverse reactions.  There is no risk of interaction with concomitant use of mild CYP3A inhibitors.  Interaction with strong and moderate CYP3A inducers  Rifampicin, a strong CYP3A inducer, significantly decreased exposure to naldemedine by 83% . Concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers such as St. Johnâ€™s wort ( Hypericum perforatum ), rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin is not recommended.  Concomitant use of naldemedine with moderate inducers (e.g. efavirenz) has not been established, and patients should be monitored (see section  4.4). Interaction with strong P -gp inhibitors  Concomitant use of P -gp inhibitors such as cyclosporine may incre ase plasma concentrations of naldemedine. If naldemedine is used with strong P -gp inhibitors , monitor for adverse reactions.
