4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction   
 4 Use with other vaccines  Arexvy may be adm inistered concomitantly with inactivated seasonal influenza vaccines (standard dose unadjuvanted, high dose unadjuvanted, or standard dose adjuvanted ).  Upon concomitant administration of Arexvy with seasonal influenza vaccines, numerically lower RSV A and B neutralising titres and numerically lower influenza A and B haemagglutination inhibition titres were observed as compared to the separate administrati on. This was not observed consistently across studies. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown.  If Arexvy is to be given at the same time as another injectable vaccine, the vaccines should always be administered at different injection sites.  
 Concomitant administration of Arexvy with other vaccines than those listed above has not been studied.
