4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No formal medicinal product interaction studies ha ve been performed with Caelyx pegylated liposomal , although phase  II combination trials with conventional chemotherapy agents have been conducted in patients with gynaecological malignancies. Exercise caution in the concomitant use of medicinal products kn own to interact with standard doxorubicin hydrochloride. Caelyx pegylated liposomal , like other doxorubicin hydrochloride preparations, may potentiate the toxicity of other anti-cancer therapies. During clinical trials in patients with solid tumours (inclu ding breast and ovarian cancer) who have received concomitant cyclophosphamide or taxanes, no new  additive toxicities were noted. In patients with AIDS , exacerbation of cyclophosphamide -induced haemorrhagic cystitis and enhancement of the hepatotoxicity of 6- mercaptopurine have been reported with standard doxorubicin hydrochloride. Caution must be exercised when giving any other cytotoxic agents, especially myelotoxic agents, at the same time.
