4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 As Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva  contains efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil, any interactions that have been identified with these agents individually may  
 
10 
 occur with Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva . Interaction studies with these agents have only been performed in adults. 
 As a fixed combination, Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva  should not be administered concomitantly with other medicinal products containing the components, emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil. Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva  should not be co-administered with products containing efavirenz unless needed for dose adjustment e.g. with rifampicin (see section 4.2). Due to similarities with emtricitabine, Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva  should not be administered concomitantly with other cytidine analogues, such as lamivudine. Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva  should not be administered concomitantly with adefovir dipivoxil or with medicinal products containing tenofovir alafenamide . 
 Efavirenz is an in vivo inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and UGT1A1. Compounds that are substrates of these enzymes may have decreased plasma concentrations when co-administered with efavirenz. Efavirenz may be an inducer of CYP2C19 and CYP2C9; however, inhibition has also been observed in vitro and the net effect of co-administration with substrates of these enzymes is not clear (see section 
5.2). 
 Co-administration of efavirenz with metamizole, which is an inducer of metabolising enzymes including CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 may cause a reduction in plasma concentrations of efavirenz with potential decrease in clinical efficacy. Therefore, caution is advised when metamizole and efavirenz are administered concurrently; clinical response and/or drug levels should be monitored as appropriate.  
 Efavirenz exposure may be increased when given with medicinal products (for example ritonavir) or food (for example, grapefruit juice) which inhibit CYP3A4 or CYP2B6 activity. Compounds or herbal preparations (for example Ginkgo biloba extracts and St. John’s wort) which induce these enzymes may give rise to decreased plasma concentrations of efavirenz. Concomitant use of St. John’s wort is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Concomitant use of Ginkgo biloba extracts is not recommended (see section 4.4). 
 In vitro and clinical pharmacokinetic interaction studies have shown the potential for CYP-mediated interactions involving emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil with other medicinal products is low. 
 Cannabinoid test interaction  
 Efavirenz does not bind to cannabinoid receptors. False-positive urine cannabinoid test results have been reported with some screening assays in uninfected and HIV-infected subjects receiving efavirenz. Confirmatory testing by a more specific method such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry is recommended in such cases. 
 Contraindications of concomitant use  
 Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva  must not be administered concurrently with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, midazolam, triazolam, pimozide, bepridil, or ergot alkaloids (for example, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, and methylergonovine), since inhibition of their metabolism may lead to serious, life-threatening events (see section 4.3). 
 Elbasvir/grazoprevir  Co-administration of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva  with elbasvir/grazoprevir is contraindicated because it may lead to loss of virologic response to elbasvir/grazoprevir ( see section 4.3 and Table  1). 
 Voriconazole Co-administration of standard doses of efavirenz and voriconazole is contraindicated. Since Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva  is a fixed-dose combination product, the dose of efavirenz cannot be altered; therefore, voriconazole and Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva must not be co-administered (see section 4.3 and Table 1).  
 
11 
  St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) Co-administration of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva  and St. John’s wort or herbal preparations containing St. John’s wort is contraindicated. Plasma levels of efavirenz can be reduced by concomitant use of St. John’s wort due to induction of drug metabolising enzymes and/or transport proteins by St. John’s wort. If a patient is already taking St. John’s wort, stop St. John’s wort, check viral levels and if possible efavirenz levels. Efavirenz levels may increase on stopping St. John’s wort. The inducing effect of St. John’s wort may persist for at least 2 weeks after cessation of treatment (see section 4.3). 
 QT prolonging drugs  Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva is contraindicated with concomitant use of drugs that are known to prolong the QTc interval and could lead to Torsade de Pointes, such as: antiarrhythmic s of classes IA and III, neuroleptics and antidepressant agents, certain antibiotics including some agents of the following classes: macrolides, fluoroquinolones, imidazole, and triazole antifungal agents, certain non -sedating antihistaminics (terfenadine,  astemizole), cisapride, flecainide, certain antimalarials and methadone (see section 4.3).  
 Concomitant use not recommended  
 Atazanavir/ritonavir Insufficient data are available to make a dosing recommendation for atazanavir/ritonavir in combination with efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil. Therefore co-administration of atazanavir/ritonavir and Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva  is not recommended (see Table 1). 
 Didanosine Co-administration of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva  and didanosine is not recommended (see Table 1). 
 Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir  and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir  Co-administration of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir is not recommended (see section 4.4 and Table 1) . 
 Renally eliminated medicinal products Since emtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily eliminated by the kidneys, co-administration of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva  with medicinal products that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion (e.g. cidofovir) may increase serum concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir and/or the co-administered medicinal products. 
 Use of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva  should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic medicinal product. Some examples include, but are not limited to, aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, foscarnet, ganciclovir, pentamidine, vancomycin, cidofovir or interleukin-2 (see section 4.4). 
 Praziquantel  Concomitant use of praziquantel  with efavirenz is not recommended due to significant decrease in plasma concentrations of praziquantel, with risk of treatment failure due to increased hepatic metabolism by efavirenz. In case the combination is needed, an increased dose of praziquantel could be considered.

 A similar reduction in indinavir exposures was observed when indinavir 1,000  mg q8h was given with efavirenz 600  mg q.d. (CYP3A4 induction)  For co-administration of efavirenz with low -dose ritonavir in combination with a protease inhibitor, see section on ritonavir below.  Insufficient data are  available to make a dosing recommendation for indinavir when dosed with the combination of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil. While the clinical significance of decreased indinavir concentrations has not been established, the magnitude of the observed pharmacokinetic interaction should be taken into consideration  when choosing a regimen containing both  efavirenz, a component of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva , and indinavir.

Clinically significant interactions have not been found and would not be expected since the NRTIs are metabolised via a different route than efavirenz and would be unlikely to compete for the same  metabolic enzymes and elimination pathways.  Due to the similarity  between lamivudine and emtricitabine, a component of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva , Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva  should not be administered concomitantly with lamivudine  (see section 4.4).

Since use of two NNRTIs  proved not beneficial in terms of efficacy and safety, co -administration of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva  and another NNRTI is not recommended.  Didanosine/tenofovir disoproxil  Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine results in a 40-60% increase in systemic exposure to didanosine.  Co-administration of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva and didanosine is not recommended.  Increased systemic exposure to didanosine may increase didanosine related adverse reactions. Rarely, pancreatitis and lactic acidosis, sometimes f atal, have been reported. Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine at a dose of 400 mg daily has been associated with a significant decrease in CD4 cell count, possibly due to an intracellular interaction increasing phosphorylated (i.e. act ive) didanosine. A decreased dosage of 
250 mg didanosine co -administered with tenofovir disoproxil therapy has been associated with reports of high rates of virological failure within several tested combinations for the treatment of HIV -1 infection.
