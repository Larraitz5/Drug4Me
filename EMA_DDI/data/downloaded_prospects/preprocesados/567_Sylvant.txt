4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No interaction studies have been performed.  
 In non-clinical studies, interleukin -6 (IL -6) is known to decrease the activity of cytochrome P450 (CYP 450). Binding bioactive IL-6 by siltuximab may result in increased metabolism of CYP 450 substrates, because CYP450 enzyme activity will normali se. Therefore, administering siltuximab with CYP450 substrates that have a narrow therapeutic index has the potential to change therapeutic effects and toxicity of these medicinal products due to alteration in the CYP450 pathways. Upon initation or discontinuation of siltuximab in patients being treated with concomitant medicinal products  that are CYP450 substrates and have a narrow therapeutic index, monitoring of the eff ect (e.g., warfarin) or concentration of medicinal product (e.g., cyclosporine or theophylline) is recommended. The dose of 5 the concomitant medicinal products  should be adjusted as needed. The effect of siltuximab on CYP450 enzyme activity can persist for several weeks after stopping therapy. Prescribers should also exercise caution when siltuximab is co -administered with medicinal products that are CYP3A4 substrates where a decrease in effectiveness would be undesirable (e.g., oral contraceptives).  
 Paediatric population  No interaction studies have been performed in this population.
