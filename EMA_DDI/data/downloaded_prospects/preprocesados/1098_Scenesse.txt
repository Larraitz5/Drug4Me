4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 No specific interaction studies have been performed with this medicinal product . Pharmacokinetic data for afamelanotide or  any of  its metabolites are very limited . As an oligopeptide with a short half -life, afamelanotide is expected to be rapidly hydrol ysed into shorter peptide fragments and into its individual amino acids. However, due to the lack of data caution is warranted.  Patients taking substances which reduce coagulation, such as vitamin K antagonists (e.g. warfarin ), acetylsalicylic acid  and non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs) may experience increased bruising or bleeding at the site of implantation.
