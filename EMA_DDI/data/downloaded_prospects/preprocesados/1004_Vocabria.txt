4.5 Interaction with othe r medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Vocabria injection,  in combination with rilpivirine injection , is indicated for the treatment of HIV -1, therefore, the prescribing information for rilpivirine injection should be consulted for associated interactions.  
 Effect of other medicinal products  on the pharmacokinetics of cabotegravir  
 Cabotegravir is primarily metabolised by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase ( UGT ) 1A1 and to a lesser extent by  UGT1A9. Medicinal products which are strong inducers of UGT1A1 or UGT1A9 are expected to decrease cabotegravir plasma concentrations leading to lack of efficacy (see section 4.3  and table 6 below ). In poor metabolizers of UGT1A1, representing a maximum clinical UGT1A1 inhibition, the mea n AUC, C max and C tau of oral cabotegravir increased by up to 1.5- fold. The impact of an UGT1A1 inhibitor may be slightly more pronounced, however, considering the safety margins of cabotegravir, this increase is not expected to be clinically relevant. No d osing adjustments for Vocabria are, therefore, recommended in the presence of UGT1A1 inhibitors  (e.g. atazanavir, erlotinib, sorafenib) . 
 Cabotegravir is a substrate of P-glycoprotein ( P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ), however, because of its high permeability, no alteration in absorption is expected when co-administered with either P -gp or BCRP inhibitors.  
 Effect of cabotegravir on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products  
 In vivo , cabotegravir did not have an effect on  midazolam, a cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 3A4 probe. In vitro , cabotegravir did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4.  
 In vitro  cabotegravir inhibited organic anion transporters (OAT) 1 (IC 50=0.81 µM) and OAT3 (IC 50=0.41 µM). T herefore , caution is advised when c o-dosing with narrow therapeutic index OAT1/3 substrate drugs (e.g. methotrexate).  
 Vocabria and rilpivirine injections  are intended for use as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection and should not be administered with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of HIV. The following information regarding drug- drug interactions with other ant iretroviral medicinal products is provided in the event that Vocabria and rilpivirine injections are stopped and initiation of an alternative antiviral therapy is necessary (see section 4.4).  Based on the in vitro and clinical drug interaction profile, cabotegravir is not expected to alter concentrations of other anti -retroviral medications including protease inhibitors, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non -nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, integrase inhibitors, entry inhibitors  or ibalizumab.  
 No drug interaction studies have been performed with cabotegravir injection. The drug interaction data provided in Table 6 is obtained from studies with oral cabotegravir  (increase is indicated as “↑”, 9 decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔ ”, area und er the concentration versus time curve as “AUC”, maximum observed concentration as “C max”, concentration at end of dosing interval as “Cτ”) .

 Medicinal products by therapeutic areas  Interaction  Geometric mean change (%)  Recommendations concerning co-administration  HIV-1 Antiviral medicinal products  Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor:  Etravirine  Cabotegravir ↔ AUC ↑  1% Cmax ↑ 4% Cτ ↔ 0% 
 Etravirine did not significantly change cabotegravir plasma concentration. No dose adjustment of Vocabria is necessary when initiating injections following etravirine use.  Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor:  Rilpivirine  Cabotegravir ↔ AUC ↑  12%  Cmax ↑ 5% Cτ ↑ 14%  
 Rilpivirine ↔  AUC ↓  1% Cmax ↓ 4% Cτ ↓ 8% 
 Rilpivirine did not significantly change cabotegravir plasma concentration. No dose adjustment of Vocabria injection is necessary when co-administered with rilpivirine.  Anticonvulsants  Carbamazepine  Oxcarbazepine  Phenytoin  Phenobarbital  Cabotegravir ↓ Metabolic inducers may significantly decrease cabotegravir plasma concentration. Concomitant use is contraindicated  (see section 4.3) . Antimycobacterials  Rifampicin  
 
 Cabotegravir ↓ AUC ↓  59%  Cmax ↓ 6% Rifampicin significantly decreased cabotegravir plasma concentration which is likely to result in loss of therapeutic effect. Dosing recommendations for co -administration of Vocabria with rifampicin have not been established and co- administration of Vocabria with rifampicin is contraindicated (see section 4.3) . 
 Rifapentine  Cabotegravir ↓ Rifapentine may significantly decrease cabotegravir plasma concentrations. Concomitant use is contraindicated  (see section 4.3) . Rifabutin  
 Cabotegravir ↓ AUC ↓  21%  Cmax ↓ 17%  Cτ ↓ 8% Rifabutin may decrease cabotegravir plasma concentration. Concomitant use should be avoided.  Oral contraceptives  Ethinyl estradiol (EE) and Levonorgestrel (LNG)  EE ↔ AUC ↑  2% Cmax ↓ 8% Cτ ↔ 0% 
 LNG ↔  AUC ↑  12%  Cmax ↑ 5% Cτ ↑ 7% Cabotegravir did not significantly change ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel plasma concentrations to a clinically relevant extent. No dose adjustment of oral contraceptives is necessary when co -administered with Vocabria.
