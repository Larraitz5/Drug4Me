4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No formal interaction studies  have been performed.  
 In vitro  metabolism studies in human liver microsomes suggest that DM1, a component of trastuzumab emtansine, is metabolised mainly by CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, by CYP3A5.   Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., k etoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, and voriconazole) with trastuzumab emtansine should be avoided due to the potential for an increase in DM1 exposure and toxicity . Consider an alternate medicinal product with no or minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4.  If concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is unavoidable, consider delaying trastuzumab emtansine treatment until the strong CYP3A4 inhibitors have cleared from  the circulation (approximately 3 elimination half -lives of the inhibitors) when possible.  If a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is coadministered and trastuzumab emtansine treatment cannot be delayed, patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactions.
