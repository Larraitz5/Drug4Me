4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No interaction studies have been performed.  
 Efgartigimod alfa may decrease concentrations of compounds that bind to the human neonatal Fc Receptor (Fc 
 Rn), i.e., immunoglobulin pr oducts, monoclonal antibodies, or antibody derivatives containing the human Fc domain of the Ig 
 G subclass. If possible, it is recommended to postpone initiation of treatment with these products to 2  weeks after the last dose of any given treatment cycle of Vyvgart. As a precaution, patients receiving Vyvgart while on treatment with these products should be closely monitored for the intended efficacy response of those products.  
 Plasma exchange, immunoadsorption, and plasmapheresis may reduce circulating lev els of efgartigimod alfa.  
 All vaccines should be administered according to immunisation guidelines.  The potential interaction with vaccines was studied in a nonclinical model using Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) as the antigen. The weekly administration of 100  mg/kg to monkeys did not impact the immune response to KLH immunisation.  For patients that are being treated with efgartigimod alfa, vaccination with live or live -attenuated vaccines is generally not recommended. If vaccination with live or live -attenuated vaccines is required, these vaccines should be administered at least 4  weeks before treatment and at least 2  weeks after the last dose of a treatment cycle efgartigimod alfa (see section  4.4).
