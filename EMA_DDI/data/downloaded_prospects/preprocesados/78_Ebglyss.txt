4.5 Interaction with other medicinal product s and other forms of interaction  
 No interaction studies have been performed .  
 Live vaccines  
 The safety and efficacy of concurrent use of lebrikizumab with live and live attenuated vaccines has not been studied. L ive and live attenuated vaccines should not be given concurrently with lebrikizumab.  
 Non-live vaccines  
 Immune responses to non- live va ccines were assessed in a study in which adult patients with atopic dermatitis were treated with lebrikizumab 500 mg at weeks 0 and 2 followed by lebrikizumab 250 mg every other week. After 12 weeks of lebrikizumab administration, patients were vaccinated with a combined tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine Tda 
 P vaccine (T cell -dependent) and a meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (T  cell-independent) and immune responses were assessed 
4 weeks later.  Antibody responses  to both non-live vacci nes were  not negatively impacted  by the concomitant lebrikizumab treatment. No adverse interactions between the non- live vaccines and lebrikizumab were noted in the study. Therefore, patients receiving lebrikizumab may receive concurrent inactivated or non- live vaccinations. For information on live vaccines see section 4.4.  
 Concomitant therapies 
 Given that lebrikizumab is a monoclonal antibody, no pharmacokinetic interactions are expected.
