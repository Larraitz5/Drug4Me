4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other form s of interaction  
 CYP3A4  inhibitors  
 Co-treatment with potent CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole, ritonavir, itraconazole, clarithromycin, cobicistat and grapefruit juice may cause a marked increase of the plasma concentration of budesonide and is  expected to increase the risk of systemic adverse reactions . Therefore, concomitant use should be avoided unless the benefit outweighs the increased risk of systemic corticosteroid adverse reaction s, in which case patients should be monitored for systemic corticosteroid adverse reaction s.  
 Ketoco nazole 200 mg once daily orally  increased the plasma concentration of budesonide (3 mg single dose) approximately 6-fold during concomitant administration. When ketoconazole was administered approximately 12 hours after budesonide, the plasma concentr ation  of budesonide  increased approximately 3-fold.  
 Oestrogens, oral contraceptives 
 Elevated plasma concentrations and enhanced effects of glucocorticosteroids have been reported in women also receiving oestrogens or oral contraceptives. No such effect  has been observed with budesonide and concomitant intake of  low-dose combination oral contraceptives.  
 Cardiac glycosides  
 The action of glycoside can be potentiated by potassium deficiency which is a potential and known adverse reaction  of glucocorticoids .  
 Saluretics   
 Concommitant use of glucocorticoids  may result in enhanced potassium excretion  and aggravated hypokalaemia .
