4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 Tislelizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody, cleared from the circulation through catabolism. As such, formal p harmacokinetic interaction studies have not been conducted. As monoclonal antibodies are not metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes or other drug-metabolising enzymes, inhibition or induction of these enzymes by co-administered medicinal products is not anticipated to affect the pharmacokinetics of tislelizumab.  
 The use of systemic corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants at baseline, before starting tislelizumab , except for physiological doses of systemic corticosteroid (10  mg/day prednisone or equivalent), should be avoided because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy . However, systemic corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants can be used after starting tislelizumab  to treat immune -related adverse reactions (see section  4.4).
