4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of inte raction   
 Effect of other medical products  on the pharmacokinetics of t emsavir   
 Temsavir is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ), but not of organic anion transporters OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. Its biotransformation to two circulating metabolites, BMS -646915 and BMS -930644, is mediated by unidentified esterase s (36.1%)  and by cytochrome P 450 (CYP )3A4 enzyme  (21.2%) , respectively.  
 When fostem savir was co -administered with the  strong CYP3A inducer rifampicin, a significant reduction in temsavir plasma concentrations was observed. Significant decreases in temsavir plasma concentrations may also occur when fostemsavir is co -administered with other strong CYP3A inducers, and may r esult in loss of virologic response  (see section 4.3) . 
 5 Fostemsavir may be co -administered with strong CYP3A4, BCRP and/or P -gp inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole) without dose adjustment based on the results of clinical drug interaction studies with cobicistat and ritonavir.    
 Effect of temsavir on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products   
 In vitro , temsavir inhibited OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 (IC 50 = 32 and 16 µ M, respectively). Additionally, temsavir and its two metabolites (BMS -646915 and BMS -930644) inhibited BCRP (IC 50 
= 12, 35, and 3.5 to 6.3 µM, respect ively). Based on these data, temsavir is expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of active substances that are substrates of OATP1B1/3 or BCRP (e.g. rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, simvastatin, pitavastatin and fluvast atin). Therefore, dose modifications and/or careful titration of dose is recommended for certain statins .

 Although not studied, c linically relevant increases in plasma concentrations of pravastatin are not expected as it is not a substrate o f BCRP. No dose adjustment is requir ed. 9 Hepatitis C virus Direct -Acting Antivirals (HCV DAAs) : Elbasvir/Grazoprevir

 Although not studied, temsavir may increase plasma concentrations of other HCV DAAs. No dose adjustment is necessary.  
1Potential mechanism(s) of drug interactions  
 QT prolonging medicinal products  
 There is no information available on the potential for a pharmacodynamic interaction between fostemsavir and medicinal products that prolong the QTc interval of the ECG. However, based on a study of healthy subjects, in which a supratherapeutic dose of fostemsavir prolonged the QTc interval, fostemsavir should be used with caution when co- administered with a medicinal product with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes (see sections 4.4).
