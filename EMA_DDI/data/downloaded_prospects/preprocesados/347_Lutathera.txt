4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Somatostatin analogues  
 Somatostatin and its analogues competitively bind to somatostatin receptors  and may interfere with the efficacy of Lutathera . Therefore, a dministration of long -acting somatostatin analogues should be avoided within 30  days prior to the administration of this medicinal product . If necessary, patients may be treated with short -acting somatostatin  analogues up to  24 hours preceding Lutathera  administration . 
 Glucocorticoids  
 There is some evidence that glucocorticoids  can induce down -regulation of subtype  2 somatostatin receptors  (SSTR2). Therefore , as a matter of cautio n, repeated administration of high  doses of glucocortico ids should be avoided during Lutathera  treatment. Patients with a history of chronic use of glucocortico ids should be carefully evaluated for sufficient somatostatin receptor expression. It is not known  whether the intermittent use of glucocorticoids  for the prevention of nausea and vomiting during Lutathera administration could induce SSTR2 down -regulation.  As a matter of caution, glucocortico ids should also be avoided as preventive antiemetic treatment. In the event that  the treatment  administered for the prevention of nausea and vomiting before the amino acid solution infusion proves  insufficient, a single glucocorticoid dose can be used, provided  it is not given before initiating or within one hour after the end of Lutathera  infusion .
