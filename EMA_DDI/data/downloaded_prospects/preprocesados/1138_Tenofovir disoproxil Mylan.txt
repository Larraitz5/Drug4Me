4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Interaction studies have only been pe rformed in adu lts. 
 Based on the results of in vitro expe riments and the known elimination path way of tenofovir, the potential for CYP450 -mediated interactions involving tenofovir with other medicinal produc ts is low. 
 11 
 Concomitant use not recommended  
 Tenofovir disoproxil  shou ld not  be administered conco mitantly with other medicinal produc ts containing tenofovir disoproxil or tenofovir alafenamide.  
 Tenofovir disoproxil  shou ld not  be administered conco mitantly with ade fovir dipivoxil. 
 Didanos ine Co-administration of  tenofovir disoproxil and d idanos ine is not recommended  (see section 4.4 and Table 1). 
 Rena lly eliminated medicinal produc ts Since tenofovir is primarily eliminated by  the kidneys, co-administration of  tenofovir disoproxil with medicinal produc ts that reduce  renal function or  compete for active tubular secretion via transpo rt proteins h 
 OAT 1, h 
 OAT 3 or MRP 4 (e.g. cidofovir) may increase serum concen trations of  tenofovir and/or the co-administered medicinal produc ts. 
 Use of tenofovir disoproxil shou ld be avoided with concu rrent or recent  use of a neph rotoxic medicinal produc t. Some examples include, but  are not limited to, aminoglycosides, a mphotericin B, foscarnet, ganciclovir, pentamidine, vanco mycin, cidofovir or interleukin-2 (see section 4.4 ). 
 Given that tacrolimus can a ffect renal function, c lose monitoring is recommended when it is co-administered with tenofovir disoproxil. 
 Other interactions  
 Interactions between tenofovir disoproxil and other medicinal products  are listed in Table 1 below (increase is indicated as  “↑”, dec rease as “↓”, no chan ge as “↔”, twice daily as “b.i.d.”, and once  daily as “q.d.” ).

Darunavir:  No significant effect on darunavir/ritonavir  PK parameters.  Tenofovir:  AUC: ↑ 22%  Cmin: ↑ 37%  No dose adjustment is recommended. The increased exposure of tenofovir could potentiate te nofovir-associated a dverse events, including renal disorders. Renal function should be closely monitored (see section 4.4). NRTIs  Didanosine Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil   and didanosine results in a  40-60% increase in systemic exposure to didanosine .  Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine is not recommended (see section 4.4). 
 Increased systemic exposure to didanosine may increase didanosine related adverse reactions.  Rarely, pancreatitis and lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, have been reported.  Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine at a dose of 
400 mg daily has been associated with a significant decrease in CD4 cell count, possibly due to an intracellular interaction increasing phosphorylat ed (i.e. active) didanosine. A decreased dosage of 
250 mg didanosine co-administered with tenofovir disoproxil therapy has been associated with reports of high rates of virological failure within several tested combinations for the treatment of HIV -1 infec tion. Adefovir dipivoxil AUC: ↔  Cmax: ↔ Tenofovir disoproxil should not be administered concurrently with adefovir dipivoxil (see section 4.4). 13

 Studies conducted with other medicinal products  There were no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions when tenofovir disoproxil was co-administered with emtricitabine, lamivudine, indinavir, efavirenz, nelfinavir, saqu inavir (ritonavir boos ted), methadone, ribavirin, rifampicin, tacrolimus, or  the hormonal contraceptive norgestimate/ethinyl oestradiol. 
 Tenofovir disoproxil must be taken with food, as  food enhances  the bioavailability of tenofovir (see section 5.2 ).
