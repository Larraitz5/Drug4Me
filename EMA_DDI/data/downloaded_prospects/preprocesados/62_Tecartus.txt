4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 No interaction studies have been performed  with Tecartus . 
 Prophylactic use of systemic corticosteroids may interfere with the activity of Tecartus. Prophylactic use of systemic corticosteroids is therefore not recommended before infusion (see section  4.2).  
 Administration of cortico steroids as per the toxicity management guidelines  does not impact the expansion and persistence of CAR T cells.  
 Live vaccines  
 The safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines during or following Tecartus treatment has not been studied. As a precautionary measure, vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 6 week s prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, during Tecartus treatment, and until immune recovery following treatment.
