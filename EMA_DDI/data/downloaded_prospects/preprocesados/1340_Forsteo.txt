4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products  and other forms of interaction  
 In a study of 15 healthy subjects administered digoxin daily to steady state, a single FORSTEO dose did not alter the cardiac effect of digoxin. However, sporadic case repo rts have s ugge sted that hypercalcaemia may predispo se patients to dig italis toxicity. Because FORSTEO transiently increases serum calcium, FORSTEO should be used with caution in patients taking digitalis. 
 FORSTEO has been evaluated in pharmacodynamic inte raction st udies with hydrochlorothiazide. No clinic ally significant interactions were noted.  
 Co-administration of raloxifene or hormone replacement therapy with FORSTEO did not alter the effects of FORSTEO on serum or urine calcium or on clinical adverse events.
