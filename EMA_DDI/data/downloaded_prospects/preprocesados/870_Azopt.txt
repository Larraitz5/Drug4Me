4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Specific interaction studies with other medicinal products have not been performed with AZOPT.  
 In clinical studies, AZOPT was used concomitantly with prostaglandin analogues and timolol ophthalmic preparations without evidence of adverse interactions. As sociation between AZOPT and miotics or adrenergic agonists has not been evaluated during adjunctive glaucoma therapy.  
 AZOPT is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and, although administered topically, is absorbed systemically. Acid -base disturbances have been reported with oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. The potential for interactions must be considered in patients receiving AZOPT.  5  The cytochrome P -450 isozymes responsible for metabolism of brinzolamide include CYP3A4  (main), CYP2A6, CYP2C8  and CYP2C9. It is expected that inhibitors of CYP3A4  such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, clotrimazole, ritonavir and troleandomycin will inhibit the metabolism of brinzolamide by CYP3A4. Caution is advised if CYP3A4  inhibitors are given concomitantly. However, accumulati on of brinzolamide is unlikely as renal elimination is the major route. Brinzolamide is not an inhibitor of cytochrome P -450 isozymes.
