4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Midostaurin undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism  mainly  through CYP3A4  enzymes  which are either induced or inhibited by a number of concomitant medicinal products . 
 Effect of other medicinal products  on R ydapt  
 Medicinal products  or substances known to affect the activity of CYP3A4 may affect the plasma concentrations of midostaurin and therefore the safety and/or efficacy of  Rydapt . 
 Strong CYP3A4 inducers  Concomitant use of Rydapt with strong inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g. carbamazepine, rifampicin, enzalutamide, phenytoin, St. Johnâ€™s Wort [ Hypericum perforatum ]) is contraindicated  (see section  4.3). Strong CYP3A4 inducers decrease exposure of midostaurin and its active metabolites (CGP52421 and CGP62221). In a study in healthy subjects, co -administration of the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin (600  mg daily) to steady state with a 50 mg single dose of midostaurin decreased midostaurin C max by 73% and AUC inf by 96%  on average , respectively. CGP62221 exhibited a similar pattern. The mean AUC last of CGP52421 decreased by 60%.  
 Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors  Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase midostaurin blood concentrations. In a study with 36  healthy subjects , co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole to steady  state with a single dose of 50 mg midostaurin  led to a significant increase in midostaurin exposure ( 1.8-fold Cmax increase and 10-fold AUC inf increase)  and 3.5 -fold increase in AUC inf of CGP62221 , while the Cmax of the active metabolites (CGP62221 and CGP52421 ) decreased by half  (see section  5.2). At steady state of midostaurin (50  mg twice daily for 21  days), with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole at steady  state in a subset of patients (N=7), midostaurin steady -state exposure (C min) was increased by 
2.09-fold. Cmin of CGP52421 was increased by 1.3 -fold, whereas no significant effect in exposure of CGP62221 was observed  (see section  4.4). 
 8 Effect of R ydapt  on other medicinal products  
 Substrates of CYP enzymes  In healthy subjects, co -administration of a single dose of bupropion (CYP2B6 substrate) with multiple doses of midostaurin (50  mg twice daily) at steady  state decreased bupropion AUC inf and AUC last by 
48% and 49% respectively and C max by 55% compared to administration of bupropion alone. This indicates that midostaurin is a mild inducer of CYP2B6. Medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic range that are substrates of CYP2B6 (e.g. bupropion or efavirenz)  should be used with caution when administered concomitantly with midostaurin, and may need dose adjustment to maintain optimal exposure.  
 Based on in-vitro  data, midostaurin and its active metabolites, CGP52421 and CGP62221, are inhibitors of CYP1A2 and CYP2E1 and inducers of CYP1A2. Therefore, medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic range that are substrates of CYP1A2 (e.g. tizanidine) and CYP2E1 (e.g.  chlorzoxazone) should be used with caution when administered concomitantly with midostaurin, and may need dose adjustment to maintain optimal exposure.  
 Substrates of transporters  In healthy subjects, co -administration of a single dose of rosuvastatin (BCRP substrate) with a single dose of midostaurin (100  mg) increased rosuvastatin AUC inf and AUC last by 37% and 48% respectively; C max was approximately doubled (2.01  times) compared to administration of rosuvastatin alone. This indicates that midostaurin has a mild inhibitory effect on BCRP substrates. Medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic range that are substrates of the transporter BCRP (e.g. rosuvastatin or atorvastatin) sho uld be used with caution when administered concomitantly with midostaurin, and may need dose adjustment to maintain optimal exposure.  
 Hormonal contraceptives  There was no clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug -drug interaction between multiple doses of midostaurin (50  mg twice daily) at steady  state and oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel in healthy women. Therefore , it is not anticipated that the contraceptive reliability of this combination will be compromised by co -administration of midostaurin.  
 Food interactions  
 In healthy subjects, midostaurin absorption (AUC) was increased by an average of 22% when Rydapt was co -administered with a standard meal and by an average of 59% when co -administered with a high-fat meal. Peak midostaurin concentration (C max) was reduced by 20% with a standard meal and by 27% with a high -fat meal versus on an empty stomach (see section  5.2). 
 Rydapt is recommended to be administered with food.
