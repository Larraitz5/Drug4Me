4.5 Interaction with other medi cinal products and other forms of interaction 
 Pharmacokinetic interacti ons 
 No interaction studies have been performed with Bevespi Aerosphere ;however, the potential for metabol icinteractions is considered to be low based on in-vitro studies (see section 5.2).Since glycopyrronium is elimi nated mainly by the renal route, interaction scould potentially occur with medicinal products affecting r enal excretion mechanisms. In-vitroglycopyrronium is a substrate for the renal transport ers OCT2 and MATE1/2K. The effect of cimetidine, a probe inhibitor of OCT2 and MATE1, on inhaled glycopyrronium disposition showed a limited increase in its total syst emic exposure (AUC 0-t) by 22% a nda slight decrease in renal clearance by 23% due to co -administration of cimetidine.Pharmacodynamic interaction s5Other antimu scarinics and sympat homimetics 
 Co-administration of Bevespi Aerosphere with other anticholinergi c and/or long -acting β 2-adrene rgic agonist containing medicinal produc ts has not been stu died and is not recommended as it may potentiate known i nhaled muscarinic antagonist or β2-adrenergic agonist adverse reactions (see section s4.4 and 4.9).Although no formal in-vivo interaction studies have been performed with Bevespi Aero sphere ,studies indicate no clinical evidence of inte ractions when used concomitantly with other COPD medicinal products including short -acting β 2-adrenergic bronchodi lators, methylxanthines, an doral and inhaled steroids.Drug -induced hypokalaemia 
 Concomitant treatment with methylxanthine derivatives, ster oids, or non -potas sium sparing diuretics may potentiate the possible initial hypokalaemic effect of β 2-adrenergic agonists, therefore ,cautio nis advised in their concomitant use (see section 4.4). 
β-adrenergic blockers
β-adrenergic blockers (including e ye drops) can weak en or inhibit the effect of β2-adrenergic agonists, such as formoterol. Concurrent use of either non-selective or selective β-adrenergic blockers should be avoided unless there are compelling reasons for their use. If β-adrenergic blocker sare required (including eye drops), cardioselective β-adrenergic blockers are preferred, although they should al so be administered with cau tion.Other pharmacodynamic interactions 
 Bevespi Aerosphe reshould be administered with caution to patients being treated with medic inal products known to prolong the QTc interval (see section 4.4).
