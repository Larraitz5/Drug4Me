4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No interaction studies have been performed.   
 Given the route of administration (topical), the short duration of dosing (5  days), the low systemic exposure (subnanomolar mean C max), and the in vitro  data, there is low potential for  interaction with tirbanibulin ointment at maximum clinical exposure.
