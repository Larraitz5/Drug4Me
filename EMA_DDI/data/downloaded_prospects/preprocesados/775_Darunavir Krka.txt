4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 The interaction pr ofile of darunavir may differ depending on whether ritonavir or cobicistat is used as pharmacoenhancer. The recommendations given for concomitant use of darunavir and other medicinal products may therefore differ depending on whether darunavir is boosted w ith ritonavir or cobicistat (see sections 4.3 and 4.4), and caution is also required during the first time of treatment if switching the pharmacoenhancer from ritonavir to cobicistat (see section 4.4).Medicinal products that affect darunavir exposure (ri tonavir as pharmacoenhancer)Darunavir and ritonavir are metabolised by CYP3A. Medicinal products that induce CYP3A activity would be expected to increase the clearance of darunavir and ritonavir, resulting in lowered plasma concentrations of these compou nds and consequently that of darunavir, leading to loss of therapeutic effect and possible development of resistance (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). CYP3A inducers that are contraindicated include rifampicin, St John’s wort and lopinavir.Co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir with other medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A may decrease the clearance of darunavir and ritonavir, which may result in increased plasma concentrations of darunavir and ritonavir. Co -administration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is not recommended and caution is warranted, these interactions are described in the interaction table below (e.g. indinavir, azole antifungals like clotrimazole).Medicinal products that affect darunavir exposure (cobicistat as pharmacoenhancer)Daruna vir and cobicistat are metabolised by CYP3A, and co -administration with CYP3A inducers may ther efore result in subtherapeutic plasma exposure to darunavir. Darunavir boosted with cobicistat is more sensitive to CYP3A induction than ritonavir -boosted daruna vir: co -administration of darunavir/cobicistat with medicinal products that are strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g. St John’s wort, rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin) is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Co -administration of darunavir/cob icistat with weak to moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g. efavirenz, etravirine, nevirapine, fluticasone, and bosentan) is not recommended (see interaction table below).For co -administration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, the same recommendations apply independ ent of whether darunavir is boosted with ritonavir or with cobicistat (see section above).Medicinal products that may be affected by darunavir boosted with ritonavir 
 Darunavir and ritonavir are inhibitors of CYP3A, CYP2D6 and P -gp. Co -administration of darunavir/ritonavir with medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP3A and/or CYP2D6 or transported by P -gp may result in increased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse react ions.Darunavir co -administered with low dose ritonavir must not be combined with medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which increased systemic exposure is associated with serious and/or life -threatening events (narr ow ther apeutic index) (see section 4.3).Co-administration of boosted darunavir with drugs that have active metabolite(s) formed by CYP3A may result in reduced plasma concentrations of these active metabolite(s), potentially leading to loss of their thera peutic effect (see the Interaction table below).The overall pharmacokinetic enhancement effect by ritonavir was an approximate 14 -fold increase in the systemic exposure of darunavir when a single dose of 600 mg darunavir was given orally in combination with ritonavir at 100 mg twice daily. Therefore, darunavir must only be used in combination with a pharmacokinetic enhancer (see section s 4.4 and 5.2).10A clinical study utilising a cocktail of medicinal products that are metabolised by cytochromes CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 demonstrated an increase in CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 activity and inhibition of CYP2D6 activity in the presence of darunavir/ritonavir, which may be attributed to the presence of low dose ritonavir. Co -administration of darunavir and ritonavi r with medicinal products which are primarily metabolised by CYP2D6 (such as flecainide, propafenone, metoprolol) may result in increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products, which could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and advers e reactions. Co -administration of darunavir and ritonavir with medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP2C9 (such as warfarin) and CYP2C19 (such as methadone) may result in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could decrease or shorten their therapeutic effect.Although the effect on CYP2C8 has only been studied in vitro , co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir and medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP2C8 (such as paclitaxel, rosiglitazone, repaglinide) may res ult in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could decrease or shorten their therapeutic effect.Ritonavir inhibits the transporters P -glycoprotein, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, and co -administration with substrates of these transporters c an result in increased plasma concentrations of these compounds (e.g. dabigatran etexilate, digoxin, statins and bosentan; see the Interaction table below).Medicinal products that may be affected by darunavir boosted with cobicistat 
 The recommendations for darunavir boosted with ritonavir are similar to the recommendations for darunavir boosted with cobicistat with regard to substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, P -glycoprotein, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 (see contraindications and recommendations presented in the secti on above). Cobicistat 150 mg given with darunavir 800 mg once daily enhances darunavir pharmacokinetic parameters in a comparable way to ritonavir (see section 5.2).Unlike ritonavir, cobicistat does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or UGT1A1. For further information on cobicistat, consult the cobicistat Summary of Product Characteristics.Interaction table 
 Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.Several of the interaction studies (indicated by #in the table below) have been performed at lower than recommended doses of darunavir or with a different dosing regimen (see section 4.2 Posology). The effects on co -administered medicinal products may thus be underestimated and clinical monitoring o safety may be indicated.The interaction profile of darunavir depends on whether ritonavir or cobicistat is used as pharmacokinetic enhancer. Darunavir may therefore have different recommendations for concomitant medicinal products depending on whether the compound is boosted wit h ritonavir or cobicistat. Nointeraction studies presented in the table have been performed with darunavir boosted with cobicistat. The same recommendations apply, unless specifically indicated. For further information on cobicistat, consult the cobicista t Summary of Product Characteristics.Interactions between darunavir/ritonavir and antiretroviral and non -antiretroviral medicinal products are listed in the table below. The direction of the arrow for each pharmacokinetic parameter is based on the 90% co nfidence interval of the geometric mean ratio being within ( ↔), below (↓) or above (↑) the 80 -125% range (not determined as “ND”) .In the table below the specific pharmacokinetic enhancer is specified when recommendations differ. When the recommendation is the same for darunavir when co -administered with a low dose ritonavir or cobicistat, the term “boosted darunavir” is used .11The below list of examples of drug -drug interactions is not comprehensive and therefore the label of each drug that is co -adminis tered with darunavir should be consulted for information related to the route of metabolism, interaction pathways, potential risks, and specific actions to be taken with regards to co -administration.Table 1.Interactions and dose recommendations with medicinal products

Furthermore, AUC of the sum of active moieties of rifabutin (parent drug + 25 -O-desacetyl metabolite) was increased 1.6 -fold, while C maxremained comparable.Data on comparison with a 150 mg once daily  reference dose is lacking.(Rifabutin is an inducer and substrate of CYP3A.) An increase of systemic exposure to darunavir was observed when darunavir co -administered with 100 mg ritonavir was co -administered with rifabutin (150 mg once eve ry other day ).A dose reduction of rifabutin by 75% of the usual dose of 300 mg/day  (i.e. rifabutin 150 mg once ever y other day) and increased monitoring for rifabutin related adverse events is warranted in patients receiving the combinatio n with darunavir co-administered with ritonavir. In case of safety issues, a further increase of the dosing interval for rifabutin and/o r monitoring of rifabutin levels should be considered.Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate treatment o f tuberculosis in HIV infected patients.Based upon the safety profile of darunavir/ritonavir, the increase in darunavir exposure in the presence of rifabutin does not warrant a dose adjustment for darunavir/ritonavir.Based on pharmacokinetic modeling, this dose reduction of 75% is also applicable if patients receive rifabutin at doses other than 
300mg/day .Co-administration of darunavir co -administered with cobicistat and rifabutin is not recommended.ANTINEOPLASTICS Dasatinib
