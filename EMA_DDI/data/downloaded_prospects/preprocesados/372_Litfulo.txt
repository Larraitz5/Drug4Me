4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 Potential fo r other medicin alproducts to affect thepharmacokinetics of ritlecitinib 
 The coadministration of multiple 200 mg doses of itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increased the area under curve ( AUC)infof ritlecitinib by approximately 15%. This is not considered clinically significant and , therefore dose adjustment is not required when ritlecitinib is coadministered with CYP3A inhibitors.The coadministration of multiple 600 mg doses of rifampicin, a strong inducer of CYP enzymes, decreased the AUC infof ritlecitinib by approximately 44%. This is not considered clinically significant and, therefore dose adjustment is not required when ritlecitinib is coadministered with inducers of CYP enzymes.Potential for ritlecitinib to affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products 
 Multiple doses of 200 mg once daily ritlecitinib increased the AUC infand C maxof midazolam a CYP3A4 substrate, by approximately 2.7-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively. Ritleciti nibis a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A ; caution should be exercised with concomitant use of ritlecitinib with C YP3A substrate s(e.g., quinidine, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, pimozide) where moderate concentration changes may lead to serious adve rse reactions .Dose adjustment recommendations for the CYP3A substrate (e.g., colchicine, everolimus, tacrolimus, sirolimus) should be considered. Multiple doses of 200 mg once daily ritlecitinib increased the AUC infand C maxof caffeine , a CYP1A2substrate, by approximately 2.7-foldand 1.1 -fold, respectively. Ritlecitinib is a moderate inhibitor of CYP1A2 ;caution should be exe rcised with concomitant use of ritlecitinib with other CYP1A2 substrates (e.g., tizanidine) where moderate concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions .Dose adjustment recommendations for the CYP1A2 substrate (e.g., theophylline, pirfenidone) should be considered. The coadministration of a single 400 mg dose of ritlecitinib increased the AUC infof sumatriptan (an organic cation transporter [OCT ]1substrate )by approximately 1.3 to 1.5-fold relative to sumatriptan dose given alone. The increase in sumatriptan exposure is not considered clinically relevant .Caution should be exercised with concomi tant use of ritlecitinib with OCT1 substrates where small concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions.7Ritlecitinib did not produce clinically significant changes in the exposures of oral contraceptives (e.g., ethinyl oestradiol or levonorgestrel), CYP2B6 substrates (e.g., efavirenz) , CYP2C substrates (e.g., tolbutamide), or substrates of organic anion transporter ( OAT )P1B1, breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP ),and OAT3 (e.g., rosuvastatin). Paediatric population 
 Interactio n studies have only been performed in adults.
