4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Pharmacokinetic properties of oseltamivir , such as low protein binding and metabolism independent of the CYP450 and glucuronidase systems (see section 5.2), suggest that clinically significant drug interactions via these mechanisms are unlikely.  
 Probenecid  No dose adjustment is required when co -administering with probenecid in patients with normal renal function. Co- administration of probenecid, a potent inhibitor of the anionic pathway of renal tubular secretion, results in an approximate 2- fold increase in exposure to the active metabolite of o seltamivir.  
 Amoxicillin  Oseltamivir has no kinetic interaction with amoxicillin, which is eliminated via the same pathway, suggesting that oseltamivir interaction with this pathway is weak.  
 Renal elimination  Clinically important drug interactions involving competition for renal tubular secretion are unlikely, due to the known safety margin for most of these substances, the elimination characteristics of the active metabolite (glomerular filtration and anionic tubular secretion) and the excretion capacity of these pathways. However, care should be taken when prescribing oseltamivir in subjects when taking co-excreted agents with a narrow therapeutic margin ( e.g. chlorpropamide, methotrexate, phenylbutazone).  
 Additional information  No pharmacokinetic interactions between oseltamivir or its major metabolite have been observed when co- administering oseltamivir with paracetamol, acetylsalicylic acid, cimetidine, antacids (magnesium and aluminium hydroxides and calc ium carbonates), rimantadine or warfarin (in subjects stable on warfarin and without influenza).
