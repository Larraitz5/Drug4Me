4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of  interaction  
 No evidence exists that indicate s that treatment with epoetin zeta alters the metabolism of other medicinal products.  
 Medicinal products  that decrease erythropoiesis may decrease the response to epoetin zeta.  
 15 Since c yclosporin is bound by RBCs  there is potential for a drug interaction . If epoetin zeta is given  concomitantly with c yclosporin, blood levels of c yclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haema tocrit rises.  
 No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin zeta and G -CSF or GM -CSF with regard to haematological differentia tion or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro . 
 In female adult patients with metastatic breast cancer, subcutaneous co -administration of 
40 000 IU/m 
 L epoetin alfa with trastuzumab 6 mg/kg had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab.
