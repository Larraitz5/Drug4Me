4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Effect of other medicinal products on lenvatinib 
 Chemotherapeutic agents 
 Concomitant administration of lenvatinib, carboplatin, and paclitaxel has no significant impact on the pharmacokinetics of any of these 3 substances.  
 Effect of lenvatinib on other medicinal products 
 A clinical drug -drug interaction (DDI) study in cancer patients showed that plasma concentrations of midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A and Pgp substrate) were not altered in the presence of lenvatinib. No significant drug -drug interaction is therefore expected b etween lenvatinib and other CYP3A4/Pgp substrates.  
 Oral contraceptives  
 It is currently unknown whether lenvatinib may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, and therefore women using oral hormonal contraceptives should add a barrier method (see section 
4.6).
