4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No interaction studies with other medicinal products have been perform ed. 
 In vitro  studies have shown that olopatadine did not inhibit metabolic reactions which involve cytochrome P -450 isozymes 1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. These results indicate that olopatadine is unlikely to result in metabolic interactions with other conco mitantly administered active substances.
