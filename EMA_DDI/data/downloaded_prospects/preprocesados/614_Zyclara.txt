4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No interaction studies have been performed.  This includes studies  with immunosuppressive medicinal products . Interactions with systemic medicinal products would be limited by the minimal percutaneous absorption of imiquimod cream.  
 Due to its immunostimulating properties, imiquimod cream should be used with caution in p atients who are receiving immunosuppressive medicinal products (see section 4.4).  
 Concomitant use of Zyclara and any other imiquimod creams in the same treatment area should be avoided since they contain the same active ingredient (imiquimod) and may incr ease the risk for and severity of local skin reactions.
