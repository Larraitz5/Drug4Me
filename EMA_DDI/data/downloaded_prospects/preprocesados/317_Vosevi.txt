4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 As Vosevi  contains sofosbuvir , velpatasvir  and voxilaprevir , any interactions that have been identified with these  active substances individually may occur with Vosevi . 
 Pharmacokinetic interactions  
 Potential for Vosevi  to affect other medicinal products  
 Velpatasvir  and voxilaprevir are  inhibitor s of drug transporter s P-gp, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion- transporting polypeptide ( OATP ) 1B1 and OATP1B3. Co -administration of Vosevi  with medicinal products that are substrates of these transporters  may increase the exposure of such medicinal products . Medic inal products that are sensitive substrates of these transporters and for which elevated plasma levels are associated with serious event s are contraindicated (see Table 2). Dabigatran etexilate (P -gp substrate) and rosuvastatin (OATP1B and BCRP subst rate) are contraindicated (see s ection  4.3 and Table  2).  
 Potential for other medicinal products to affect Vosevi  
 Sofosbuvir , velpatasvir  and voxilaprevir  are substrates of drug transporter s P-gp and BCRP. Velpatasvir  and voxilaprevir  are substrates of drug transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. In  vitro,  slow metabolic turnover of velpatasvir primarily by CYP2B6, C YP2C8 and CYP3A4 and of voxila previr primarily by CYP3A4 was observed.  
 Medicinal products that may decrease plasma exposure of Vosevi  Medicinal products that are strong inducers of P -gp and/or strong inducers of CYP2B6, CYP2C8, or CYP3A4 (e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin, rifabutin and St. John’s wort)  may decrease plasma concentrations of sofosbuvir , velpatasvir and/or voxilaprevir  leading to reduced therapeutic effect of Vosevi . The use of such medicinal products with Vosevi  is contraindicated (see section  4.3 and Table 2). 
 Medicinal products that are moderate P -gp inducers and/or moderate CYP inducers (e.g. efavirenz, modafinil , oxcarbazepine or rifapentine ) may decrease sofosbuvir , velpatasvir and/or voxilaprevir plasma concentrations  leading to reduced therapeutic effect of Vosevi . Co-administration with such medicinal products is not recommended with Vosevi  (see section  4.4 and Table  2). 
 Medicinal products that may increase plasma exposure of Vosevi  Co-administration with medicinal products that inhibit P -gp or BCRP may increase sofosbuvir , velpatasvir  or voxilaprevir  plasma concentrations . Medicinal products that inhibit  OATP 1B, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, or CYP3A4 may increase plasma concentration s of velpatasvir  or voxilaprevir . The use of strong inhibitors of OATP 1B (e.g. ciclosporin)  with Vosevi  is not recommended  (see section  4.4 and Table  2). Clinically significant medicinal product interactions with Vosevi  mediated by P-gp, BCRP  and CYP  inhibitors  are not expected . Vosevi  may be c o-admi nistered with P -gp, BCRP  and CYP inhibitors.  
 7 Pharmacodynamic interactions  
 Patients treated with vitamin K antagonists  
 As liver function may change during treatment with Vosevi , close monitoring of International Normalised Ratio (INR) values is recommended.  
 Impact of DAA therapy on medicinal products  metabolized by the liver  
 The pharmacokinetics of medicinal products  that are metabolized by the liver (e.g. immunosuppressive agents such as calcineurin inhibitors) may be impacted by changes in li ver function during DAA therapy, related to clearance of HCV.  
 Patients treated with ethinylestradiol -containing medicinal products  
 Concomitant use with ethinylestradiol -containing medicinal products may increase the risk of alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) elevations  and is contraindicated  (see section  4.3 and Table  2). 
 Interactions between Vosevi  and other medicinal products  
 Table  2 provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant medicinal product interactions (where 90% confidenc e interval [CI] of the geometric least -squares  mean [GLSM] ratio were within “↔”, extended above “↑”, or extended below “↓” the predetermined interaction boundaries). The medicinal product interactions described are based on studies conducted with either sofosbuvir /velpatasvir /voxilaprevir , its components (sofosbuvir, velpatasvir , and/or voxilaprevir) , or are predicted medicinal product interactions that may occur with Vosevi . The table is not all-inclusive .
