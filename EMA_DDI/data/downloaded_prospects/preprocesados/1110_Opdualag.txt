4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms o f interaction  
 Nivolumab and relatlimab are both human monoclonal antibodies  and as such , no interaction studies have been conducted. As monoclonal antibodies are not metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes or other active substances metabolising enzymes, inhibition or induction of these enzymes by co-administered medicinal products is not anticipated to affect the pharmacokinetics of relatlimab  or nivolumab. 
 Nivolumab and relatlimab are not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of other active substances that are metabolised by CYP enzyme s given the lack of significant modulation of cytokines by nivolumab and relatlimab and therefore lack of effect on expression of cytochrome P450 enzyme.  
 USystemic immunosuppression The use of systemic corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants at baseline, before starting  nivolumab in combination wit h relatlimab , should be avoided because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic  activity. However, systemic corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants can be used after starting  nivolumab in combination with relatlimab  to treat immune -related adverse reactions.
