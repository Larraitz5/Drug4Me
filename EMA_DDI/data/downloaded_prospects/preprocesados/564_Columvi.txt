4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No interaction studies have been performed. No interactions with Colum vi are expected via the cytochrome  P450 enzymes, other metabolizing enzymes or transporters.   
 The initial release of cytokines associated with the start of Columvi treatment could suppress CYP450 enzymes. The highest drug- drug interaction risk is during the period of one week following each of the first 2 doses o f Columvi  (i.e., Cycle 1 Day 8 and 15) in patients who are receiving concomitant CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., warfarin, cyclosporine). On initiation of Columvi  therapy, patients being treated with CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index should be monitored.
