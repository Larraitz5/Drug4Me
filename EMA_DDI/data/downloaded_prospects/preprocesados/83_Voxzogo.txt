4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction   
 In vitro  cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibition and induction studies and in vitro  transporter inhibition studies have been performed. Results suggested that vosoritide is unlikely to cause CYP - or transporter -mediated drug- drug interactions in humans when the medicinal product is administered concomitantly with other medicinal products.  
 No other interaction studies have been performed. Because it is a recombinant human protein, vosoritide is an unlikely candidate for drug- drug interactions.
