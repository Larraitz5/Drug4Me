4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 At least 1  month should elapse between receipt of a live virus vaccine and Pro 
 Quad .Vaccine recipients should avoid use of  salicylates f or 6  weeks  after vaccination with Pro 
 Quad (seesection 4.4).Do not give immunoglobulin (IG
) or Varicella -Zoste r Immune Globulin (VZIG) concomitantly with 
 Pro 
 Quad.Administ ration of  immune globulins conc omitantly with Pro 
 Quad may interfere with the expectedimmun e response. Vaccination should be deferred for at least 3 months f ollowing blood or plasmatransf usions, or administration of immune globulins (IG). However, the app ropriate suggested intervalbetween transf usion or IG administration and vaccination will vary with the type of transfusion orindication for, and dose of, IG (e.g. 5 months for VZIG).Administration of  varicella zoster virus antibody
-containing blo od pro ducts, in cluding VZ IG or otherimmune globulin preparations, within 1 month following a dose of Pro 
 Quad may reduce the immuneresponse to the vaccine and hence reduce its
 protective efficacy. Therefore, administration of any ofthese products should be avo ided with in 1 month  after a dos e of Pro 
 Quad unless considered to beessential.It has been  reported that live attenuated measles, mumps and rubella virus vaccines given individuallymay result  in a temporary depression of tuberculin skin sensitivity
. Ther ef ore, if  a tubercu lin test is tobe done, it should be administered either any time before
, simultaneously with, or at
 least 4 to 6 weeksafter immunization with Pro 
 Quad
.Concomitant use with
 other vaccines:Clinical studies have demonstrated that Pro 
 Qua d can be given simultaneously ( but at separateinjection sites) with Prevenar and/or hepatitis A vaccine, or with monovalent or combination vaccinescomprised of diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b, inactivatedpoliomyel itis, or hepatitis B antigen.  In these clinical studies, it was demonstrated that the immune 7responses were unaf f ected.
 The safety profiles of the administered vaccines were comparable  (seesection 4.8).There are insuff icient data to support the use of  P ro 
 Quad wi th any oth er vaccines.
