4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic medicinal products or with other agents that compete for CYP3A4 enzyme metabolism may increase the frequency or severity of dry mouth, constipation, and drowsiness.  
 4 Anticholinerg ic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered medicinal products due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. As oxybutynin is metabolised by cytochrome P 450 isoenzyme CYP3A4, interactions with medicinal  products that inhibit this isoenzyme cannot be ruled out. This should be borne in mind when using azole antifungals (e.g. ketocona zole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g. erythromycin) concurrently with oxybutynin.  
 The anticholinergic activity of oxybutynin is increased by concurrent use of other anticholinergics or medicinal products with anticholinergic activity, such as amantadine and other anticholinergic antiparkinsonian medicinal products (e.g. biperiden, levodopa), antihistamines, antipsychotics (e.g. phenothiazines, butyrophenones, clozapine), quinidine, tricyclic antidepressants, atropine and related compounds like atropinic antispasmodics, dipyridamole.  
 Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic age nts such as oxybutynin (see section 4.7).  
 Oxybutynin may antagonize prokinetic therapies.
