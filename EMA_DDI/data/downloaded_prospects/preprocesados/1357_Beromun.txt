4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No interaction studies have been performed. 
 Beromun has been co- administered with interferon- gamma in the ILP setting but no added value has been demonstrated. The addition of interferon- gamma to the tasonermin perfusate seems not to be associated with significant increases in endogenous production of tasonermi n or other inflammatory cytokines as shown in patients with severe trauma. Clinical data however indicate that the overall incidence of adverse events is increased if patients are simultaneously exposed to tasonermin and interferon -gamma.  
 Combinations wit h cardiotoxic substances (e.g. anthracyclines) should be avoided because it is possible that tasonermin could enhance cardiotoxicity, as has been observed in preclinical 13- week toxicological investigations  (see section 4. 4). 
 A number of therapeutic measu res are routinely used during the ILP and in the immediate post-operative period. These include standard anaesthetic agents, analgesics, antipyretics, intravenous fluids, anticoagulants and vasopressor agents. There is no evidence that any of these agents counteracts the pharmacodynamic effects of tasonermin. No significant interactions have so far been noted, but caution should be exercised (see section 4.4).  
 Concurrent administration of agents likely to cause significant hypotension is not recommended (s ee section 4.4) . 
 The Summary of Product Characteristics for melphalan should be consulted for information on the interactions of melphalan.
