4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 Viekirax may be administered with or without dasabuvir. When co -administered, they exert mutual effects on each other (see section 5.2). Therefore ,the interaction profile of the compounds must be considered as a combination.Pharmacodynamic interactions 
 Coadministration with enzyme inducers may increase the risk of adverse reactions and ALT elevations (see Table 2). Coadministration with ethinyl oestradiol may increase the risk of ALT elevations (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). Examples of contraindicated enzyme inducers are provided in section 4.3.Pharmacokinetic interactions 
 Potential for Viekirax to affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal p roducts 
 In vivo drug interaction studies evaluated the net effect of the combination treatment, including ritonavir.The following section describes the specific transporters and metabolizing enzymes that are affected by Viekirax with or without dasabuvir . See Table 2 for guidance regarding potential interactions with other medicinal products and dosing recommendations.Medicinal products metabolised by CYP3A4Ritonavir is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A. Co -administration of Viekirax with or without dasabuvir with medicinal products primarily metabolized by CYP3A may result in increased plasma concentrations of these medicinal products. Medicinal products that are highly dependent on C YP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma levels are associated with serious events are contraindicated (see section 4.3 and Table 2 ). CYP3A substrates evaluated in drug interaction studies which may require dose adjustment and/or clinical monitor ing include (see Table 2) ciclosporin, sirolimus, tacrolimus, amlodipine, rilpivirine andalprazolam. Examples of other CYP3A4 substrates which may require dose adjustment and/or clinical monitoring include calcium channel blockers (e.g. nifedipine), and t razodone. Although buprenorphine and zolpidem are also metabolized by CYP3A, drug interaction studies indicate that no dose adjustment is needed when co -administering these medicinal products with Viekirax with or without dasabuvir (see Table 2). Medicin al products transported by the OATP family and OCT1Paritaprevir is an inhibitor of the hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 ,and paritaprevir and ritonavir are inhibitors of OATP2B1. Ritonavir is an in vitro inhibitor of OCT1, but the clinical relevance is unknown. Co-administration of Viekirax with or without dasabuvir with medicinal products 10that are substrates of OATP1B1, OAT P1B3, OATP2B1 or OCT1 may increase plasma concentrations of these transporter substrates, potentially requiring dose ad justment/clinical monitoring. Such medicinal products include some statins (see Table 2), fexofenadine, repaglinide and angiotensin II receptor antagonists (e.g., valsartan).OATP1B1/3 substrates evaluated in drug interaction studies include pravastatin androsuvastatin (see Table 2). Medicinal products transported by BCRPParitaprevir, ritonavir and dasabuvir are inhibitors of BCRP in vivo . Co-administration of Viekirax with or without dasabuvir together with medicinal products that are substrates of BCRP may increase plasma concentrations of these transporter substrates, potentially requiring dose adjustment/clinical monitoring.  Such medicinal products include sulfasalazine, imatinib and some of the statins (see Table 2).BCRP substrates evaluated i n drug interaction studies include rosuvastatin (see Table 2).Medicinal products transported by P -gp in the intestine 
 While paritaprevir, ritonavir and dasabuvir are in vitro inhibitors of P -gp, no significant change was observed in the exposure of the P -gp substrate digoxin when administered with Viekirax and dasabuvir. However, co -administration of digoxin with Viekirax without dasabuvir may result in increased plasma concentrations (see Table 2). Viekirax may increase the plasma exposure to medicinal p roducts that are sensitive for changed intestinal P -gp activity (such as dabigatran etexilate).Medicinal products metabolised by glucuronidation (UGT1A1)Paritaprevir, ombitasvir and dasabuvir are inhibitors of UGT1A1. Co -administration of Viekirax with or without dasabuvir with medicinal products that are primarily metabolized by UGT1A1 result in increased plasma concentrations of such medicinal products; routine clinical monitoring is recommended for narrow therapeutic index medicinal products (i .e.levothyroxine). See also Table 2 for specific advice on raltegravir and buprenorphine , which have been evaluated in drug interaction studies .Medicinal products metabolised by CYP2C19Co-administration of Viekirax with or without dasabuvir can decrease expos ures of medicinal products that are metabolized by CYP2C19 (e.g. lansoprazole, esomeprazole, s -mephenytoin) , which may require dose adjustment/clinical monitoring. C YP2C19 substrates evaluated in drug interaction studies include omeprazole and escitalopram (see Table 2).Medicinal products metabolised by CYP2C9Viekirax administered with or without dasabuvir did not affect the exposures of the CYP2C9 substrate, warfarin. Other CYP2C9 substrates (NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen), antidiabetics (e.g. glimepiride, gli pizide) are not expected to require dose adjustments. Medicinal products metabolised by CYP2D6 or CYP1A2Viekirax administered with or without dasabuvir did not affect the exposures of the CYP2D6/CYP1A2 substrate, duloxetine. Exposures of cyclobenzaprine, a CYP1A2 substrate, were decreased. Clinical monitoring and dose adjustment may be needed for other CYP1A2 substrates (e.g. ciprofloxacin, cyclobenzaprine, theophylline and caffeine). CYP2D6 substrates (e.g. desipramine, metoprolol and dextromethorphan) are not expected to require dose adjustments. Medicinal products renally excreted via transport proteins 
 Ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir do not inhibit organic anion transporter (OAT1) in vivo as shown by the lack of interaction wi th tenofovir (OAT1 substrate). In vitro studies show that ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir are not inhibitors of organic cation transporters (OCT2), organic anion 11transporters (OAT3), or multidrug and toxin extrusion proteins (MATE1 and MATE2K) at c linically relevant concentrations. Ther efore, Viekirax with or without das abuvir is not expected to affect medicinal products which are primarily excreted by the renal route via these transporters (see section 5.2). Potential for other medicina l products to affect the pharmacokinetics of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and dasabuvir 
 Medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A4Co-administration of Viekirax with or without dasabuvir with strong inhibitors of CYP3A may increase paritaprevir concentrations (see section 4.3 and Table 2 ).Enzyme inducers 
 Co-administration of Viekirax and dasabuvir with medicinal products that are moderate or strong enzyme inducers is expected to decrease ombitasvir, paritaprevir ,ritonavir and dasabuvir plasma concentrations and reduce their therapeutic effect. Contraindicated enzyme inducers are provided in section 4.3 and Table 
2.Medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A4 and transport proteins 
 Paritaprevir is eliminated via CYP3A4 mediated metabolism and biliar y excretion (substrate of the hepatic transporters OATP1B1, P -gp and BCRP). Caution is advised if co -administering Viekirax with medicinal products that are both moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 and inhibitors of multiple transporters (P -gp, BCRP and/or OATP1 B1/ OATP1B3) . These medicinal products may show clinically relevant increases in exposures of paritaprevir (e.g.,ritonavir with atazanavir, erythromycin, diltiazem or verapamil).Medicinal products that inhibit transport proteins 
 Potent inhibitors of P -gp, BCRP, OATP1B1 and/or OATP1B3 have the potential to increase the exposure to paritaprevir. Inhibition of these transporters is not expected to show clinically relevant increases in exposures of ombitasvir and dasabuvir.Patients treated with vitamin K a ntagonists 
 As liver function may change during treatment with Viekirax administered with or without dasabuvir, a close monitoring of International Normalised Ratio (INR) values is recommended.Drug interaction studies 
 Recommendations for co -administration of Viekirax with and without dasabuvir for a number of medicinal products areprovided in Table 2.If a patient is already taking medicinal product (s) or initiating a medic inal product while receiving Viekirax with or without dasabuvir for which potential for drug interaction is expected, dose adjustment of the concomitant medic inal product (s) or appropriate clinical monitoring should be considered (Table 2).If dose adjustments of concomitant medic inal products are made due to treatment with Viekirax or Viekirax with dasabuvir , doses should be re -adjusted after administration of Viekirax or Viekirax withdasabuvir is completed.Table 2 provides the Least Squares Means Ratio (90% Confidence Interval) eff ect on concentration of Viekirax with or without dasabuvir and concomitant medicinal products . 12The magnitude of interaction when administered with medicinal products listed in Table 2 are similar (≤25% difference in the Least Square Means ratio) for Viekirax with or without dasabuvir, unless otherwise noted. Drug interactions were evaluated for the Viekirax and dasabuvir regimen, but not for the Viekirax without dasabuvir, with carbamazepine, furosemide, zolpidem, darunavir twice daily, darunavir (evening administration), atazanavir (evening administration), rilpivirine, abacavir/lamivudine, dolutegravir, metformin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, cyclobenzaprine, carisoprodol, hydrocodone/paracetamol or diazepam. Thus, for these medicinal products, re sults and dosing recommendations of the Viekirax and dasabuvir regimen can be extrapolated to Viekirax without dasabuvir.The direction of the arrow indicates the direction of the change in exposures (C max,and AUC) in paritaprevir , ombitasvir, dasabuvir and the co -administered medicinal product (↑ = increase (more than 
20%), ↓ = decrease ( of more than 20%), ↔ = no change or change less than 20%) .This is not an exclusive list.Table 2. Interactions between Viekirax with or without dasabuvir and other med icinal products
