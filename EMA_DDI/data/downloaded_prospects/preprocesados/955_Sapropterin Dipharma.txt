4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Although concomitant administration of inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase (e.g. methotrexate, trimethoprim) has not been studied, such medicinal products may interfere with BH4 metabolism. Caution is recommended when using such medicinal products while taking s apropterin dihydrochloride.  BH4 is a cofactor for nitric oxide synthetase. Caution is recommended during concomitant use of sapropterin dihydrochloride with all medicinal products that cause vasodilation, including those administered topically, by affecting nitric oxide (NO) metabolism or action including classical NO donors (e.g. glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), sodium nitroprusside (SNP), molsidomin), phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors and minoxidil. 
 Caution should be exercised when prescribing s apropterin dihydrochloride to patients receiving treatment with levodopa. Cases of convulsion, exacerbation of convulsion, increased excitability and irritability have been observed during co-administration of levodopa and sapropterin in BH4-deficient patients.
