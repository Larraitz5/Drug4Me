4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 Clinical data described below suggest that the risk for clinically meaningful interactions with co-administered medicinal products is low.The metabolism of saxagliptin is primarily mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5).The co -administration of saxagliptin and CYP3A4/5 inducers, other than rifampicin (such as carbamazepine, dexamethasone, phenobarbital and phenytoin) have not been studied and may result in decreased plasma concentration of saxagli ptin and increased concentration of its major metabolite. Glycaemic control should be carefully assessed when saxagliptin is used concomitantly with a potent CYP3A4/5 inducer.6Concomitant administration of saxagliptin with the moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 /5 diltiazem, increased the C maxand AUC of saxagliptin by 63% and 2.1 -fold, respectively, and the corresponding values for the active metabolite were decreased by 44% and 34%, respectively. Concomitant administration of saxagliptin with the potent inhib itor of CYP3A4/5 ketoconazole, increased the C maxand AUC of saxagliptin by 62% and 2.5 -fold, respectively, and the corresponding values for the active metabolite were decreased by 95% and 88%, respectively.Concomitant administration of saxagliptin with the potent CYP3A4/5 inducer rifampicin, reduced C maxand AUC of saxagliptin by 53% and 76%, respectively. The exposure of the active metabolite and the plasma DPP4 activity inhibition over a dose interval were not influenced by rifampicin (see section 4.4).In in vitro studies, saxagliptin and its major metabolite neither inhibited CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 
2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, nor induced CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, or 3A4. In studies conducted in healthy subjects, neither the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin n or its major metabolite, were meaningfully altered by metformin, glibenclamide, pioglitazone, digoxin, simvastatin, omeprazole, antacids or famotidine. In addition, saxagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glibenclamide, pi oglitazone, digoxin, simvastatin, the active components of a combined oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol and norgestimate), diltiazem or ketoconazole.The effects of smoking, diet, herbal products, and alcohol use on the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptinhave not been specifically studied.
