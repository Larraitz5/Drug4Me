 Immune globulin 
 Immune globulin (IG) is not to be given concomitantly with M
-M-Rvax 
 Pro.Administration of  immune globulins concomitantly with M
-M-Rvax 
 Pro may interf ere with theexpected immune response. Vaccination should be deferred f or at least 3
 months f ollowing blood orplasma transf usions, or administration of  human immune serum globulin.Administration of  measles, mumps, or rubella antibody
-containing  blood products, including immuneglobulin preparations, should be avoided within 1  month af ter a dose of  M
-M-Rvax 
 Pro unlessconsidered to be essential.Laboratory tests 
 It has been  reported that live
 attenuated measles, mumps
 and rubella virus vaccines given individuallymay result in a temporary depression of  tuberculin skin sensitivity. Therefore, if a tuberculin test is tobe done, it should be administered either any time before, simultaneously with, or 4  to 6 weeks af tervaccination with M
-M-Rvax 
 Pro.Use with other vaccines 
 Currently  no specif ic studies have been conducted on the concomitant use of  M -M-Rvax 
 Pro and othervaccines. However, since M
-M-Rvax 
 Pro has been shown to have safety and immunogenicity prof ilessimilar to the previous formulation of  the combined measles, mumps
 and rubella vaccinemanufactured by Merck 
& Co., Inc., experience with this vaccine can be considered. 6Published clinical data support concomitant administration of  the
 previous f ormulation of  the measles,mumps  and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co
., Inc. with other childhood vaccinations,including DTa 
 P (or DTw 
 P), IPV (or OPV), HIB (Haemophilus influenzae
 type b), HIB
-HBV(Haemophilus influenzae type b with Hepatitis B vaccine), and VAR (varicella). M
-M-Rvax 
 Pro shouldbe given concomitantly at separate injection sites, or one month before or af ter administration of  otherlive virus vaccines.Based on clinical studies with the quadrivalent measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine and withthe previous f ormulation of  the combined measles, mumps
 and rubella vaccine manufactured by 
 Merck & Co., Inc., M
-M-Rvax 
 Pro can b e given simultaneously (but at separate injection sites) with 
 Prevenar an d/or hepatitis A vaccine. In these clinical studies, it was demonstrated that the immuneresponses were unaf f ected and that the overall safety profiles of the administered vaccines weresimilar.
