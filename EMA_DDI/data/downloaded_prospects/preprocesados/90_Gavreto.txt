4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 CYP3A4 and/or  P-gp inhibitors  P-gp inhibitors: Co- administration of a single 200 mg dose  of pralsetinib  with  cyclosporine single 
600  mg  dose  (a P-gp and weak -moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor ) in healthy subjects increased pralsetinib AUC 0-∞ by 81% and C max by 48%, relative to a 200 mg dose of pralsetinib administered alone.    
 Combined P -gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors: Co -administration of 200 mg pralsetinib once daily with itraconazole 200 mg once daily (a P -gp inhibitor and strong CYP3A4) increased pralsetinib  AUC 0-∞ by 251%  and C max by 84% , compared to pralsetinib administered alone.  
 Co-administration of pralsetinib  with P -gp and/or strong or moderate  CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase pralsetinib plasma concentrations, which may increase the risk of adverse reactions of pralsetinib. Co -administration of pralsetinib with the following should be a voided  (see section 4.4) :   
• combined P -gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitor s (including, but not limited to, ketoconazole, itraconazole, cobicistat, clarithromycin, ritonavir, or saquinavir)  
• strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (including, but not limited to, telithromycin,  troleandomycin, voriconazole, ceritinib, idelalisib, nefazodone, nelfinavir, or grapefruit juice)  
• moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (including, but not limited to, aprepitant, ciprofloxacin, conivaptan, crizotinib, fluconazole, fluvoxa mine, imatinib, isavuconazole, or tofisopam)  
• P-gp inhibitors (including, but not limited to, cyclosporine, carvedilol or quinidine)  
• combined P -gp and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (including, but not limited to, dronedarone, diltiazem, erythromycin, verapamil)  
 If co-administration with any of the above inhibitors cannot be avoided, reduce the current dose of pralsetinib (section  4.2).  
 Strong CYP3A4 inducers  Co-administration of pralsetinib with strong C YP3A4 inducers can decrease pralsetinib plasma concentrations, which may decrease the efficacy of pralsetinib. Co -administration of 400 mg pralsetinib as a single dose with rifampin  600 mg once daily (a strong CYP3A4 inducer) decreased pralsetinib AUC 0-∞ by 68%  and C max by 30% . Therefore, c o-administration of pralsetinib  with strong CYP3A4 inducers  (including, but not limited to, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampicin and St. John’s Wort [ Hypericum perforatum ]) should be avoided (see section 4.4) . 
 Sensitive substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, P -gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, MATE1 and MATE2 -K with narrow therapeutic index  Co-administration of pralsetinib can alter the exposure of sensitive substrates of CYP enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and CYP2C8) and transporters (P -gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, MATE1 and MATE2 -K). Substrate drugs of these CYP enzymes and transporters with narrow therapeutic index (including, but not limited to cyclosporine, paclitaxel and warfarin) should be avoided.
