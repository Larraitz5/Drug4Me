4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.P-glycoprotein (P -gp)Nintedanib is a substrate of P -gp (see section 5.2). Co -administration with the potent P -gp inhibitor ketoconazole increased exposure to nintedanib 1.61 -fold based on AUC and 1.83 -fold based on C maxin a dedicated drug -drug interaction study. In a drug -drug interaction study with the potent P -gp inducer rifampicin, exposure to nintedanib decrease d to50.3 % based on AUC and to 60.3 % based on C maxupon co -administration with rifampicin compared to administration of nintedanib alone. If co-administered with nintedanib , potent P -gp inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole or erythromycin) may increase exposure to nintedanib. In such cases, patients should be monitored closely for tolerability of nintedanib. Management of adverse reactions may require interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation of therapy with Vargatef (seesection 4.2).Potent P -gp inducers ( e.g.rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John’s Wort ) may decrease exposure to nintedanib. Co -administration with nintedanib should be carefully considered. Cytochrome (CYP) -enzymes 
 Only a minor extent of the biotransformation of nintedanib consisted of CYP pathways. Nintedanib and its metabolites, the free acid moiety BIBF 1202 and its glucuronide BIBF 1202 glucuronide, did not inhibit or induce CYP enzymes in preclinical studies (see section 5.2). The likelihood of drug -drug interactions with nintedanib based on CYP metabolism is therefore considered to be low.Co-administration with other medicinal products Co-administration of nintedanib with docetaxel (75 mg/m²) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of either medicin al produ ctto a relevant extent.Co-administration of nintedanib with oral hormonal contraceptives did not alter the pharmacokinetics of oral hormonal contraceptives to a relevant extent (see section 5.2).
