4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 The metabolism of paclitaxel is catalysed, in part, by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 (see section 5.2). Therefore, in the absence of a PK drug- drug interacti on study, caution should be exercised when administering paclitaxel concomitantly with medicinal products known to inhibit either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 (e.g. ketoconazole and other imidazole antifungals, erythromycin, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil, clopidogrel, cimet idine, ritonavir, saquinavir, indinavir, and nelfinavir) because toxicity of paclitaxel may be increased due to higher paclitaxel exposure. Administering paclitaxel concomitantly with medicines known to induce either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 (e.g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, efavirenz, nevirapine) is not recommended because efficacy may be compromised because of lower paclitaxel exposures.  
 Paclitaxel and gemcitabine do not share a common metabolic pathway. Paclitaxel clearance is primarily determined by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 mediated metabolism followed by biliary excretion, while gemcitabine is inactivated by cytidine deaminase followed by urinary excretion. Pharmacokinetic interactions between Pazenir and gemcitabine have not been evaluated in humans.  
 A ph armacokinetic study was conducted with human serum albumin- paclitaxel nanoparticles and carboplatin in non- small cell lung cancer patients. There were no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions between human serum albumin -paclitaxel nanoparticles and carboplatin.  
 Pazenir is indicated as monotherapy for breast cancer, in combination with gemcitabine for pancreatic adenocarcinoma, or in combination with carboplatin for non- small cell lung cancer (see section 4.1). Pazenir should not be used in combi nation with other anticancer agents.  
 Paediatric population  Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.
