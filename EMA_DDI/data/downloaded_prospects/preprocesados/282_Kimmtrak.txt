4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with tebentafusp.  
 Initiation of tebentafusp treatment causes transient release of cytokines that may suppress CYP450 enzymes. The highest drug-drug interaction risk is during the first 24 hours of the first three doses of tebentafusp in patients who are receiving concomitan t CYP450 substrates, particularly those with a narrow therapeutic index. These patients should be monitored for toxicity (e.g., warfarin) or drug concentrations (e.g., cyclosporine). The dose of the concomitant medicines should be adjusted as needed.
