4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No formal drug- drug interaction studies have been performed. Casirivimab and imdevimab are monoclonal antibodies, which are not renally excreted or metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes; therefore, interactions with concomitant medicinal products that are renally excreted or that are substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes are unlikely.
