4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 COPD medicinal products  
 Co-administration of Brimica  Genuair  with other anticholinergic  and/or long -acting β 2-adrenergic agonist containing medicinal products  has not been studied and is not recommended.  
 Although no formal in vivo drug interaction studies have been performed  with Brimica  Genuair, it  has been used concomitantly with other CO PD medicinal products including short -acting β2-adrenergic bronchodilators, methylxanthines, and oral and inhaled steroids without clinical evidence of drug interactions.  
 Hypokalaemic treatment  
 Concomitant treatment with methylxanthine derivatives, stero ids, or non -potassium -sparing diuretics  may potentiate the possible hypokalaemic effect of β2-adrenergic agonists, therefore caution is advised in their concomitant use (see section  4.4). 
 
β-adrenergic blockers  
 
β-adrenergic blockers may weaken or antagoni se the effect of β2-adrenergic agonists. If β-adrenergic blockers are  required  (including eye drops) , cardioselective beta -adrenergic blockers are preferred, although they should also be administered with caution.  
 Other p harmacodynamic interaction s 
 Brimi ca Genuair should be administered with caution to patients being treated with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors,  tricyclic antidepressants , antihistamines  or macrolides because the action of formotero l, a component of Brimica  Genuair , on the cardiovascular system may be potentiated by these medicinal products . Medicinal products  that are known to prolong the QTc interval are associated with an  increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias.  
 Metabolic inter actions  
 In vitro  studies have shown that aclidinium or its metabolites at the therapeutic dose are not expected to cause interactions with P-glycoprotein ( P-gp) substrate drugs or  drugs metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes  and esterases. Formot erol does not inhibit the CYP450 enzymes at therapeutically relevant concentrations (see section 5.2).
