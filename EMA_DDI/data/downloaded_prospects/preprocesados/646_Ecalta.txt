4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 Anidulafungin is not a clinically relevant substrate, inducer, or inhibitor of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A). Of note, in vitro  studies do not fully exclude possible in vivo  interactions.  
 Drug interaction studies were performed with anidulafungin and other medicinal products likely to be co-administered. No dosage adjustment of either medicinal product is recommended when anidulafungin is co-administered with ciclosporin, voriconazole or tacrolimus, and no dosage adjustment for anidulafungin is recommended when co-administered with amphotericin B or rifampicin. 
 5 Paediatric population
