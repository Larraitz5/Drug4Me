4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Since pregabalin is predominantly excreted unchanged in the urine, undergoes negligible metabolism in humans (<  2% of a dose recovered in urine as metabolites), does not inhibit drug metabolism in vitro , and is not bound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely to produce, or be subject to, pharmacokinetic interactions.  
 In vivo  studies  and population pharmacokinetic analysis  Accordingly, in in vivo  studies no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between pregabalin and phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, lamotrigine, gabapentin, l orazepam, oxycodone or ethanol. Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that oral ant idiabetics, diuretics, insulin, phenobarbital, tiagabine and topiramate had no clinically significant effect on pregabalin clearance.  Oral contraceptives, norethisterone and/or ethinyl oestradiol  Co-administration of pregabalin with the oral contraceptives norethisterone and/or ethinyl oestradiol does not influence the steady -state pharmacokinetics of either substance.  
 Central nervous s ystem  influencing medical products  Pregabalin may potentiate the effects of ethan ol and lorazepam.  
 In the postmarketing experience, there are reports of respiratory failure, coma and deaths in patients taking pregabalin and opioids and/or other central nervous system ( CNS ) depressant medicinal products. Pregabalin appears to be additive in the impairment of cognitive and gr oss motor  function caused by oxycodone. 
 Interactions and the elderly  No specific pharmacodynamic interaction studies were conducted in elderly volunteers. Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.
