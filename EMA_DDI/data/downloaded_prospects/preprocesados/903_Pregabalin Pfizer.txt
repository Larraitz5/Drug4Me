4.5 Interaction with other medicinal pr oducts and other fo rms of interaction  
 Since pregabalin is predominantly excreted unchange d in the urine, undergoe s negligible metabolism in humans (< 2% of a dose re covered in urine as metabolites), does not inhibit drug metabolism in vitro , and is not bound to plasma proteins, it is  unlikely to produce, or be subject to, pharmacokinetic interactions. 
 In vivo  studies and population pharmacokinetic analysis Accordingly, in in vivo  studies no clinically relevant pharm acokinetic interacti ons were observed between pregabalin and phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, lamotrigine, gabapentin, lorazepam, oxycodone or ethanol. Population pharmacokinetic anal ysis indicated that oral antidiabetics, diuretics, insulin, phenobarbital, tiagabine an d topiramate had no clinically si gnificant effect on pregabalin clearance. 
 Oral contraceptives, norethisterone and/or ethinyl oestradiol Co-administration of pregab alin with the oral contraceptives nore thisterone and/or ethinyl oestradiol does not influence the steady-state ph armacokinetics of either substance. 
 Central nervous system influencing medical products Pregabalin may potentiate the effects of ethanol and lorazepam. 
 In the postmarketing experience, there are reports of respiratory failure, coma and deaths in patients taking pregabalin and opioids and/or other central nervous system (CNS) depressant medicinal products. Pregabalin appears to be additive in  the impairment of cognitiv e and gross motor function caused by oxycodone. 
 Interactions and the elderly No specific pharmacodyna mic interaction studies we re conducted in elderly volunteers. Interaction studies have only been  performed in adults.
