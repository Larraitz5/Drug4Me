4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Use of EXPAREL liposomal with other local anaesthetics  
 The addition of local anaesthetics administered within 96  hours following administration of EXPAREL liposomal should take into account the total bupi vacaine exposure.  
 EXPAREL liposomal should be used with caution in patients receiving other local anaesthetics or active substances structurally related to amide- type local anaesthetics, e.g. certain anti- arrhythmics, such as lidocaine and mexiletine, since the systemic toxic effects are additive. 
 Other bupivacaine products The impact on pharmacokinetic and/or physicochemical properties of EXPAREL liposomal when it is co-administered with  bupivacaine HCl  is concentration dependent . Therefore,  bupivacaine HCl  can be administered simultaneously in the same syringe as long as the ratio of the milligram dose of bupivacaine HCl  solution to EXPAREL liposomal does not exceed 1:2. The total amount of bupivacaine HCl and EXPAREL liposomal being co -admin istered should not exceed 400 mg equivalents of bupivacaine HCl  in adults (see sections 4.4 and 6.6).  
 Non-bupivacaine l ocal anaesthetics  EXPAREL liposomal should only be admixed with bupivacaine as admixing with either lidocaine, ropivacaine or mepivacaine has been shown to cause an immediate release of bupivacaine from  the multivesicular liposomes of the drug delivery system. When  EXPAREL liposomal is admixed with lidocaine, lidocaine binds to  the liposomes , leading to an immediate displacement and release of bupivacaine. This displacement can be prevented by ensuring that EXPAREL liposomal is administered at least 20  minutes after administering lidocaine. There are no data to support administration of other local anaesthetics prior to administration of EXPAREL liposomal.  
 Oxidizing medicinal products  
 Patients that are administered local anaesthetics may be at increased risk of developing methaemoglobinamia when concurrently exposed to the following oxidizing medicinal products: 
 
• Nitrates/Nitrites - nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, nitric oxide, nitrous oxide 
• Local anaesthetics - benzocaine, lidocaine, bupivacaine, mepivacaine, tetracaine, prilocaine, procaine, articaine, ropivacaine  
• Antineoplastic medicinal products - cyclophosphamide, flutamide, rasburicase, isofamide, hydroxyurea 
• Antibiotics  - dapsone, sulfonamides, nitrofurantoin, para- aminosalicylic acid  
• Antimalarials  - chloroquine, primaquine 
• Anticonvulsants  - phenytoin, sodium valproate, phenobarbital 
• Other medicinal products - acetaminophen, metoclopramide, sulfa medicines (e,g., sulfasalazine), quinine  
 8 Other medicinal products  
 When a topical antiseptic, such as povidone iodine, is applied, the site should be allowed to dry before EXPAREL liposomal is administered into the site . EXPAREL liposomal should not be allowed to come into contact with antiseptics such as povidone iodine in solution  (see also s ection  6.2).
