4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.  
 This medicinal product should not be co-administered with medicinal products containing tenofovir disoproxil, tenofovir alafenamide or adefovir dipivoxil.  
 Medicinal products that may affect tenofovir alafenamide  
 Tenofovir alafenamide  is transported by P -gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) . Medicinal products  that are P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampicin , rifabutin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital  or St. John’s  wort) are expected to  decrease plasma concentrations of tenofovir alafenamide, which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of Vemlidy. Co-administration of such medicinal products with tenofovir alafenamide is not recommended.  6  Co-administration of tenofovir alafen amide with medicinal products that inhibit P -gp and BCRP  may increase plasma concentration s of tenofovir alafenamide.  Co-administration of strong inhibitors of P-gp with tenofovir alafenamide is not recommended.  
 Tenofovir alafenamide is a substrate of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in  vitro.  The distribution of tenofovir alafenamide in the body may be affected by the activity of OATP1B1 and/or OATP1B3.  
 Effect of tenofovir alafenamide on other medicinal products  
 Tenofovir a lafenamide is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 in vitro.  It is not an inhibitor  or inducer  of CYP3A in vivo.  
 Tenofovir alafenamide is not an inhibitor of human uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)  1A1 in vitro.  It is not known whether tenofovir alafenamide is an inhibitor of other UGT  enzymes.  
 Drug interaction information for Vemlidy  with potential concomitant medicinal products is summarised in Table 1 below (increase is indicated as “↑”, de crease as “↓”, no change as “↔”;  twice daily as “b.i.d.”, single  dose as “s.d.”, once daily as “q.d.”).  The drug interactions described are based on studies conducted with tenofovir alafenamide, or are potential drug interactions that may occur with Vemlidy .
