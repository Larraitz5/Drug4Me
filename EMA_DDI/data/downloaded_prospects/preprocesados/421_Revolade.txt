4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Effects of eltrombopag on other medicinal products  
 HMG Co 
 A reductase inhibitors  
 Administration of eltrombopag 75  mg once daily for 5  days with a single 10  mg dose of the OATP1B1 and BCRP substrate rosuvastatin to 39  healthy adult subjects increased plasma rosuvastatin C max 103% (90% confidence interval [ CI]: 82%, 126%) and AUC 0- 55% (90% CI: 42%, 69%). Interactions are also expected with other HMG -Co 
 A reductase inhibitors, including atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravasta tin and simvastatin.  When co -administered with eltrombopag, a reduced dose of statins  should be considered and careful monitori ng for statin adverse reactions  should be undertaken  (see section  5.2). 
 OATP 1B1 and BCRP substrates  
 Concomitant administration of eltrombopag and  OATP1B1 (e.g. methotrexate) and BCRP (e.g. topotecan and methotrexate) substrates should be undertaken with caution  (see section  5.2). 
 Cytochrome P450 substrates  
 In studies utili sing human liver microsomes, eltrombopag  (up to 100  M) showed no in vitro inhibition of the CYP450 enzymes 1A2, 2A6, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4/5, and 4A9/11 and was an inhibitor of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 as measured using paclitaxel and diclofenac as the probe substrates. Administration of eltrombopag 75  mg once daily for 7  days to 24 healthy male subjects did not inhibit or induce the metabolism of probe substrates for 1A2 ( caffeine), 2C19 (omeprazole), 2C9 (flurbiprofen), or 3A4 (midazolam) in humans. No clinically significant interactions are expected when eltrombopag and CYP450 substrates are co -administered  (see section  5.2). 
 HCV protease inhibitors  
 Dose adjustment is n ot required when eltrombopag is co -administered with either telaprevir or boceprevir. Co -administration of a single dose of eltrombopag 200  mg with telaprevir 750  mg every 
8 hours  did not alter plasma telaprevir exposure.  
 Co-administration of a single dos e of eltrombopag 200  mg with boceprevir 800  mg every 8  hours  did not alter plasma boceprevir AUC (0-), but increased C max by 20%, and decreased C min by 32%. The clinical relevance of the decrease in C min has not been established, increased clinical and laboratory monitoring for HCV suppression is recommended.  
 Effects of other medicinal products on eltrombopag  
 Ciclosporin  
 A decrease in eltrombopag exposure was observed with co -administration of 200  mg and 600  mg ciclosporin (a BCRP inhibitor). The co -administration of 200  mg ciclosporin decreased the C max and the AUC 0- of eltrombopag by 25% and 18%, respectively. The co -administration of 600  mg ciclosporin decreased the C max and the AUC 0- of eltrombopag by 39% and 24%, respectively.  Eltrombopag dose adjustment is permitted during the course of the treatment based on the patient’s platelet count (see section  4.2). Platelet count should be monitored at least weekly for 2 to 3  weeks when eltr ombopag is co -administered with ciclosporin. Eltrombopag dose may need to be increased based on these platelet counts.  13  Polyvalent cations (chelation)  
 Eltrombopag chelates with polyvalent cations such as iron, calcium, magnesium, aluminium, selenium and zinc. Administration of a single dose of eltrombopag 75  mg with a polyvalent cation -containing antacid (1  524 mg aluminium hydroxide and 1  425 mg magnesium carbonate) decreased plasma eltrombopag AUC 0- by 70% (90% CI: 64%, 76%) and C max by 70% (90% CI: 62%, 76%). Eltrombopag should be taken at least two hours before or four hours after any products such as antacids, dairy products or mineral supplements  containing polyvalent cations to avoid significant reduction in eltrombopag absorption  due to chelation (see sections  4.2 and  5.2). 
 Lopinavir/ritonavir  
 Co-administration of eltrombopag with lopinavir/ritonavir may cause a decrease in the concentration of eltrombopag. A study in 40 healthy volunteers showed that the co -administration of  a single 100 mg dose of eltrombopag with repeat dose lopinavir/ritonavir  400/100  mg twice daily resulted in a reduction in eltrombopag plasma AUC 0- by 17% (90% CI: 6.6%, 26.6%). Therefore, caution should be used when co -administration of eltrombopag with lopinavir/ritonavir  takes place. Platelet count should be closely monitored in order to ensure appropriate medical management of the dose of eltrombopag when lopinavir/ritonavir therapy is initiated or discontinued.  
 CYP1A2 and CYP2C8 inhibitors and induce rs 
 Eltrombopag is metaboli sed through multiple pathways including CYP1A2, CYP2C8, UGT1A1, and UGT1A3 (see section  5.2). Medicinal products  that inhibit or induce a single enzyme are unlikely to significantly affect plasma eltrombop ag concentrations , where as medicinal products  that inhibit or induce multiple enzymes have the potential to increase (e.g. fluvoxamine) or decrease (e.g. rifampicin) eltrombopag concentrations.  
 HCV protease inhibitors  
 Results of a drug -drug pharmacokinetic ( PK) interaction study show that c o-administration of repeat doses of boceprevir 800  mg every 8  hours  or telaprevir 750  mg every 8  hours  with a single dose of eltrombopag 200  mg did not alter plasma eltrombopag exposure to a clinically significant extent.  
 Medicinal products for treatment of ITP  
 Medicinal products used in the treatment of ITP in combination with eltrombopag in clinical studies included corticosteroids, danazol, and/or azathioprine, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and anti-D immunoglobulin. Platelet counts should be monitored when combining eltrombopag with other medicinal products for the treatment of ITP in order to avoid platelet counts outside of the recommended range (see section  4.2). 
 Food interaction  
 The administration of eltrombopag tablet or powder for oral suspension formulations with a high -calcium meal (e.g. a meal that included dairy products) significantly reduced plasma eltrombopag AUC 0-∞ and C max. In contrast, the administration of eltrombopag  2 hours before or 4  hours after a high -calcium meal or with low -calcium food [<50  mg calcium] did not alter plasma eltrombopag exposure to a clinically significant extent (see section  4.2). 
 Administration of a single 50  mg dose of eltrombopag in tablet f orm with a standard high -calorie, high-fat breakfast that included dairy products reduced plasma eltrombopag mean AUC 0-∞ by 59% and mean C max by 65%.  
 14 Administration of a single 25  mg dose of eltrombopag as powder for oral suspension with a high -calcium, m oderate -fat and moderate -calorie meal reduced plasma eltrombopag mean AUC 0-∞ by 75% and mean C max by 79%. This decrease of exposure was attenuated when a single 25  mg dose of eltrombopag powder for oral suspension was administered 2  hours before a high -calcium meal (mean AUC 0-∞ was decreased by 20% and mean C max by 14%).  
 Food low in calcium (<50  mg c alcium) , including fruit, lean ham, beef and unfortified (no added calcium, magnesium or iron) fruit juice, unfortified soya milk and unfortified grain , did not significantly impact plasma eltrombopag exposure, regardless of calorie and fat content (see sections  4.2 and 4.5).
