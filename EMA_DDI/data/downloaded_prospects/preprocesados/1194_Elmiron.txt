4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 A study in healthy subjects revealed no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions between therapeutic doses of warfarin and pentosan polysulfate sodium . No further interacti on studies have been performed.  Due to the weak anticoagulant effect of pentosan polysulfate sodium , patients, who are concomitantly treated with anticoagulants, heparin  derivatives, thrombolytic or antiplatelet agents including acetylsalicylic acid , or nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory medicinal products should be evaluated for any haemorrhag ic event in order to adapt the dose if needed (see section 4.4) .
