4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interaction studies have been performed.  
 Intraocular metabolic interactions are unlikely because ph enylephrine and ketorolac are removed from the anterior chamber by irrigation during the surgical procedure and by normal aqueous humour circulation postoperatively. The magnitude of the mydriatic effect of Omidria may be altered in patients who concurre ntly receive medicinal products that can affect pupil size, such as opioids (miotics) or non -sedating antihistamines (mydriatics).  
 Concomitant use of phenylephrine and atropine may enhance pressor effects and induce tachycardia in some patients. Phenylephri ne may potentiate the cardiovascular depressant effects of some inhalation anesthetic medicinal products. In a pharmacokinetic study evaluating Omidria, systemic exposure to each of phenylephrine and ketorolac was minimal and transient. Therefore, no int eraction is expected.
