4.5 Interaction with other medicinal prod ucts and other forms of interaction  
 Since pregabalin is predominantly excreted unchanged in the urine, undergoes ne gligible metabolism in humans (< 2% of a dose recovered in urine as metabolites), does not inhibi t drug metabolism in vitro , and is not bound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely to produce, or  be subject to, pharmacokinetic interactions.  
 In vivo  studies and population pharmacokinetic analysis Accordingly, in in vivo  studies no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between pregabalin and phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, lamotrigine , gabapentin, lorazepam, oxycodone or ethanol. Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that oral a ntidiabetics, diuretics, insulin, phenobarbital, tiagabine and topiramate had no clinically significan t effect on pregabalin clearance.  
 Oral contraceptives, norethisterone and/or ethinyl oestradiol  Co-administration of pregabalin with the oral contraceptives norethisteron e and/or ethinyl oestradiol does not influence the steady -state pharmacokinetics of either substance.  
 Central nervous system influencing medical products Pregabalin may potentiate the effects of ethanol and lorazepam.  
 In the post-marketing e xperience, there are  reports of  respiratory failure , coma  and deaths in patients taking pregabalin and opioids and/or other central nervous system ( CNS ) depressant medicinal products. Pregabalin appears to b e additive in the impairment of  cognitive and gross motor function caused by oxycodone. 
 Interactions and the elderly  No specific pharmacodynamic interaction studies were conducted in elderly vol unteers. Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.
