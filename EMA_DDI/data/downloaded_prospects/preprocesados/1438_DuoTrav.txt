4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No specific drug interaction studies have been performed  with travoprost or timolol . 
 There is a potential for additive effects result ing in hypotension and/or marked bradycardia when ophthalmic beta -blocker solution is administered concomitantly with oral calcium channel blockers, beta-adrenergic blocking agents , antiarrhythmics  (including amiodarone ), digitalis glycosides , parasympathomimetics  or guanethidine . 
 The hypertensive reaction to sudden withdrawal of clonidine can be potentiated when taking beta  blockers.  
 Potentiated systemic beta  blockade (e.g. decreased heart rate, depression) has been reported during combined treatment with CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g. quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine) and timolol.  
 Mydriasis resulting from concomitant use of ophthalmic beta  blockers and adrenaline (epinephrine) has been reported occasionally.  
 Beta blocker s may increase the hypoglycaemic effect of antidiabetic medicinal products . Beta  blockers can mask the signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia (see section  4.4).
