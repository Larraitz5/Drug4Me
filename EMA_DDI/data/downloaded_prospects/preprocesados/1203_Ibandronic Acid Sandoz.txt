4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 Medicinal product-Food Interactions 
 Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as aluminium, magnesium, iron), including milk and food, are likely to interfere with absorption of Ibandronic acid Sandoz tablets. Therefore, with such products, including food, intake must be delayed at least 30 minutes following oral administration.Bioavailability was reduced by approximately 75% when ibandronic acid tablets were administered 2 hours after a standard meal. Therefore, it is recommended that the tablets should be taken after an overnight fast (at least 6 hours) and fasting should continue for at least 30 minutes after the dose has been taken (see section 4.2).Interactions with other medicinal products 
 Metabolic interactions are not considered likely, since ibandronic acid does not inhibit the major human hepatic P450 isoenzymes and has been shown not to induce the hepatic cytochrome P450 system in rats (see section 5.2). Ibandronic acid is eliminated by renal excretion only and does not undergo any biotransformation. H2-antagonists or other medicinal products that increase gastric p 
 H.In healthy male volunteers and postmenopausal women, intravenous ranitidine caused an increase in ibandronic acid bioavailability of about 20% (which is within the normal variability of the bioavailability of ibandronic acid), probably as a result of reduced gastric acidity. However, no dosage adjustment is required when ibandronic acid is administered with H 2-antagonists or medicinal products that increase gastric p 
 H.Acetylsalicylic acid and NSAIDs Since Acetylsalicylic acid, Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs) and bisphosphonates are associated with gastrointestinal irritation, caution should be taken during concomitant administration (see section 4.4). Aminoglycosides 
 Caution is advised when bisphosphonates are administered with aminoglycosides, since both substances can lower serum calcium levels for prolonged periods. Attention should also be paid to the possible existence of simultaneous hypomagnesaemia.
