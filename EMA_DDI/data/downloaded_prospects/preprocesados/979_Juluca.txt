4.5 ).  
 Metformin  Dolutegravir increased metformin concentrations. A dose adjustment of metformin should be considered when starting and sto pping co- administration of dolutegravir/rilpivirine  with metformin, to maintain glycaemic control (see section 4.5). Metformin is eliminated renally and therefore it is of importance to monitor renal function when co- treated with dolutegravir/rilpivirine . This combination may increase the risk for lactic acidosis in patients with mode rate renal impairment (stage 3a creatinine clearance [Cr 
 Cl] 45 – 59 m 
 L/min) and a cautious approach is recommended. Reduction of the metformin dose should be highly considered .
  
 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome  
 In HIV -infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic  pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis ) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment.  
 Excipients   
 Juluca  contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose -galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product .  
 This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet , that is to say essentially ‘sodium -free’.   
 
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction   
 Juluca is intended for use as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV -1 infection and should not be administered with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of HIV . Therefore, information regarding drug- drug interactions with other antiretroviral medicinal products is not provided. Juluca  contains dolutegravir and rilpivirine, therefore any interactions identified with  these active substances are relevant to Juluca . Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.  
 Effect of o ther medicinal products  on the pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir  and rilpivirine  
 Dolutegravir is eliminated mainly through metabolism by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (UGT )1A1. Dolutegravir is also a substrate of UGT1A3, UGT1A9, cytochrome P450 ( CYP )3A4, P -glycoprotein ( P-gp), and breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ); therefore medicinal products that induce those enzymes may decrease dolutegravir plasma concentration and reduce the therapeutic effect of dolutegravir (see Table 1). Co-administration of dolutegravir/rilpivirine  and other medicinal products that inhibit these enzymes may increase dolutegravir plasma concentration (see Table 1).  
 The absorption of dolutegravir is reduced by certain anti -acid medicinal products (see Table 1).  
 Rilpivirine is primarily metabolised by CYP 3A. Medicinal products that induce or inhibit CYP3A may thus affect the clearance of rilpivirine (see section 5.2). Co -administration of dolutegravir/rilpivirine  with medicinal products that induce CYP3A may result in  decrease d plasma concentrations of rilpivirine, which could reduce the therapeutic effect of dolutegravir/rilpivirine  (see Table 1) . Co-administration of 6 dolutegravir/rilpivirine  with medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A may result in  increased plasma concentratio ns of rilpivirine  (see Table 1) . In patients with severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease, the combination of dolutegravir/rilpivirine  with a strong CYP3A inhibitor should only be used if the benefit outweighs the risk  (see section  4.2). 
 Co-administration of dolutegravir/rilpivirine  with medicinal products that increase gastric p 
 H may result in decreased plasma concentrations of rilpivirine which could potentially reduce the therapeutic effect of dolutegravir/rilpivirine . 
 Effect of dolutegravir and rilpivirine on the pharmacokinetics  of other medicinal products  
 Based on in vivo and/or in vitro  data , dolutegravir is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of medicinal products that are substrates of any major enzyme or transporter  such as CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and P -gp (for more information see section 5.2) . 
 In vitro , dolutegravir inhibited the renal organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2)  and multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter 1 (MATE 1). In vivo , a 10 -14% decrease of creatinine clearance ( secretory fraction is dependent on OC T2 and MATE1  transport ) was observed in patients. In vivo, dolutegravir may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products in which excretion is dependent upon OCT2 and/ or MATE1 (e.g. fampridine  [also known as dalfampridine] , metformin) (see Table 1  and sections  4.3 and 4.4 ). 
 In vitro , dolutegravir inhibited the renal  uptake transporter s, organic anion transporters  (OAT )1 and OAT3. Based on the lack of effect on the in vivo  pharmacokinetics of the OAT substrate tenofovir , in vivo  inhibition of OAT1 is unlikely. Inhibition of OAT3 has not been studied in vivo . Dolutegravir may increase plasma concentrations of medic inal products in which excretion is dependent upon OAT3.  
 Rilpivirine 25  mg once daily is not likely to have a clinica lly relevant effect on the exposure of medicinal products metabolised by CYP enzymes.  
 Rilpivirine inhibits P -gp in vitro  (IC
50 is 9.2 μM). In a clinical study, rilpivirine did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. However, it may not be completely excluded that rilpivirine can increase the exposure to other medicinal products  transported by P -gp that are more sensitive to intestinal P -gp inhibition, e.g. dabigatran etexilate.  
 Rilpivirine is an in vitro  inhibitor of the transporter MATE -2K with an IC
50 of < 2.7 n 
 M. The clinical implications of this finding are currently unknown.

1 The interaction between dolutegravir and/or rilpivirine and the medicinal product  was evaluated in a clinical study. All other drug- drug interactions shown are predicted.

 QT prolonging medicinal products  
 There is limited information available on the potential for a pharmacodynamic interaction between rilpivirine and medicinal products that prolong the QTc interval of the ECG. In a study of healthy subjects, supratherapeut ic doses of rilpivirine (75 mg once daily and 300 mg once daily) have been shown to prolong the QTc interval of the ECG (see section 5.1).  Dolutegravir/rilpivirine  should be used with caution when co-administered with a medicinal product with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes.
