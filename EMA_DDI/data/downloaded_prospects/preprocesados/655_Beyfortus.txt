4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction   
 No interaction studies have been performed . Monoclonal antibodies do not typically have significant interaction potential, as they do not directly affect cytochrome P450 enzymes and are not substrates of hepatic or renal transporters. Indirect effects on cytochrome P450 enzymes are unlikely as the target of nirsevimab is an exogenous virus.

 Since  nirsevimab  is a monoclonal a ntibody, a passive immunisation specific for RSV, it is not expected to interfere with the  active  immune response to co -administered  vaccines.  
 There is limited experience of co -administration with vaccines. In clinical trials, when nirsevimab was given with routine childhood vaccines, the safety and reactogenicity profile of the co- administered regimen was similar to the childhood vaccines given alone. Nirsevimab can be given concomitantly with childhood vaccines.  Nirsevimab  should not be mixed with any vaccine in the same syringe or vial (see section  6.2). When administered concomitantly with injectable vaccines, they should be given with separate syringes and at different injection sites.
