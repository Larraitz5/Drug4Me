4.5 and 5.1)  
 Immunocompromised patients:  
 It is unclear if the treatment duration of three days is sufficien t to clear the virus in immunocompromised patients, in whom prolonged viral shedding occurs. There is a potential risk of resistance development. Only limited data  are available.  
 Excipients  
 This medicinal product contains 212 mg sodium per 100 mg dose , equivalent to 10.6% of the  WHO recommended maximum daily intake of  2 g sodium  for an adult.  
 
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 Pharmacodynamic interactions 
 Due to antagonism observed in vitro, concomitant use of remdesivir with chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulphate is not recommended.  
 Pharmacokinetic interactions 
 Effects of other medicinal products on remdesivir  In vitro , remdesivir is a substrate for esterases in plasma and tissue, drug metabolizing enzyme CYP3A4 and is a substrate for Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptides  1B1 (OATP1B1) and P-glycoprotein (P -gp) transporters.  GS-704277 (a metabolite of remdesivir) is a substrate for OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 . 
 A drug-drug interaction study wa s conducted with remdesivir. Table 5 summarises the pharmacokinetic effects of studied drugs on remdesivir and metabolites GS -704277 and GS -441524. 6  Table 5: Effect of o ther d rugs on r emdesivir and m etabolites GS -704277 and GS-441524  NOTE: Interaction study conducted in healthy volunteers.  
 Effects of remdesivir on other medicinal products In vitro , remdesivir is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, UGT1A1, MATE1, OAT3, OCT1 , OATP1B1 and OATP1B3.  Until respective clinical data become available, the coadministration of sensitive substrates of these enzymes and/or transporters should be considered with caution. Remdesivir induced CYP1A2 and potentially CYP3A in vitro.  Co-administration of remdesivir with CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic index may lead to loss of their efficacy.  
 Dexamethasone is a substrate of CYP3A4 and although remdesivir inhibits CYP3A4, due to remdesivir's rapid clearance after IV administration, remdesivir is unlikely to have a significant effect on dexamethasone exposure.
