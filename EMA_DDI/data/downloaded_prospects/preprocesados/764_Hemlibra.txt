4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No adequate or well -controlled interaction studies have been conducted with emicizumab.  
 Clinical experience indicates a medicinal product interaction exists with emicizumab and a 
 PCC (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).

 There is a possibility for hypercoagulability with r 
 FVIIa or FVIII with e micizumab based on preclinical experiments. Emicizumab increases coagulation potential, therefore the FVIIa or FVIII dose required to achieve haemostasis may be lower than when used without Hemlibra prophylaxis.  
 In case of thrombotic complication, the physician should consider discontinuing r 
 FVIIa or FVIII and interrupt Hemlibra prophylaxis as clinically indicated. Further management should be tailored to the individual clinical circumstances.  
● Decision about dose modifications should take into account the half -life of medicinal products; specifically, interruption of emicizumab may not have an immediate effect.  
● Monitoring using a FVIII chromogenic assay may guide the administration of coagulation factors, and testing for thrombophilic traits m ay be considered.  
 Experience with concomitant administration of anti -fibrinolytics with a 
 PCC or r 
 FVIIa in patients receiving Hemlibra prophylaxis is limited. However, the possibility of thrombotic events should be considered when systemic anti -fibrinolyti cs are used in combination with a 
 PCC or r 
 FVIIa in patients receiving emicizumab.
