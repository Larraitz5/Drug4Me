4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No formal drug -drug interaction studies have been performed with cetrorelix . In vitro  investigations have shown that interactions are unlikely with medicinal products that are metabolised by cytochrome P450 or glucuronised or conjugated in some other way. However, the possibility of interactions with  gonadotropins or medicinal products tha t may induce histamine release in susceptible individuals, cannot be totally excluded.
