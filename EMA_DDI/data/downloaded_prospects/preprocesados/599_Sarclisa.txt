4.5 Interaction with other medicinal pr oducts and other forms of interaction  
 Isatuximab has no impact on the pharmacokinetics of  pomalidomide or carfilzomib, or vice versa. 
 Interference with serological testing Because CD38 protein is expressed on the surface of red blood cells, isatuximab, an anti-CD38 antibody, may interfere with blood bank serologic t ests with potential false positive reactions in indirect antiglobulin tests (indirect Coombs tests), antibody detection (screening) tests, antibody identification panels, and antihuman globulin (AHG)  crossmatches in patients treated with isatuximab (see section 4.4). The interference mitigation methods include treating reagent RBCs with dithiothreitol (DTT) to disrupt isatuximab binding or other locally validated methods. Since the Kell Blood group system is also sensitive to DTT treatme nt, Kell-negative units should be supplied after ruling out or identifying alloantibodies using DTT-treated RBCs. 
 Interference with Serum Protein Electrophoresis and Immunofixation Tests Isatuximab may be detected on serum protein el ectrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IFE) assays used for monitoring disease monoclonal immunoglobu lins (M-protein), and could interfere with accurate response classification based on Internati onal Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria (see section 4.4). In patients with pers istent very good partial response,  where isatuximab interference is suspected, consider using a validated isatuximab- specific IFE assay to distinguish isatuximab from any remaining endogenous M protein in the patientâ€™s serum, to facilita te determination of a complete response.
