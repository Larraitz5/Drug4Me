4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 In vitro , avibactam is a substrate of OAT1 and OAT3 transporters which might contribute to the active uptake of avibactam from the blood compartment and ,therefore ,affect its excretion. Probenecid (a potent OAT inhibitor) inhibits this uptake by 56% to 70% in vit roand, therefore, has the potential to alter the elimination of avibactam. Since a clinical interaction study of avibactam and probenecid has not been conducted, co -administration of avibactam with probenecid is not recommended.Avibactam showed no signi ficant inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes in vitro . Avibactam and ceftazidime showed no in vitro cytochrome P450 induction at clinically relevant concentrations. Avibactam and ceftazidime do not inhibit the major renal or hepatic transporters in the cli nically relevant exposure range, therefore the interaction potential via these mechanisms is considered to be low.Clinical data have demonstrated that there is no interaction between ceftazidime and avibactam, and between ceftazidime/avibactam and metron idazole.Other types of interaction 
 Concurrent treatment with high doses of cephalosporins and nephrotoxic medicinal products such as aminoglycosides or potent diuretics (e.g. furosemide) may adversely affect renal function (see section 4.4).Chloramphenicol is antagonistic in vitro with ceftazidime and other cephalosporins. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown, but due to the possibility of antagonism in vivo this drug combination should be avoided .
