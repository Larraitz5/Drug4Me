4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 Prior to etranacogene dezaparvovec administration, the patient’s existing medicinal products should be reviewed to determine if they should be modified to prevent anticipated interactions described in this section.Patients’ concomitant medications should be monitored after etranacogene dezaparvovec administration, particularly during th e first year, and the need to change concomitant medicinal products based on patient’s hepatic health status and riskshould be evaluated. When a new medication is starte d, close monitoring of ALT and Factor IX activity levels (e.g. weekly to every 2 weeks for the first month) is recommended to assess potential effects on both levels .No in vivo interaction studies have been performed.Hepatotoxic medicinal products or substances 
 Experience with use of this medicinal product in patients receiving hepatotoxic medications or using hepatotoxic substances is limited. Safety and efficacy of etranacogene dezaparvovec in these circumstances have not been establish ed (see section 4.4).Befor e administering etranacogene dezaparvovec to patients receiving p otentially hepatotoxic medicinal products or using other hepatotoxic agents (including alcohol, potentially hepatotoxic herbal products and nutritional supplements) and when deciding on the acceptability of such agents after treatment with etranacogene dez aparvovec, physicians should consider that they may reduce the efficacy of etranacogene dezaparvovec and increase the risk for more serious hepatic reactions, particularly during the first year following etranacogene dezaparvo vec administration (see sectio n4.4).Interactions with agents that may reduce or increase plasma concentrations of corticosteroids 
 Agents that may reduce or increase the plasma concent ration of corticosteroids (e.g.agents that in duce or inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4) can decrease the efficacy of the corticosteroid regimen or increase their side effects (see section 4.4).Vaccinations 
 Prior to etranacogene dezaparvovec infusion, ensure that the patient’s vaccinations are up to date. The patient’s vaccination sche dule may need to be adjusted to accommodate concomitant immuno modulatory therapy (see section 4.4). Live vaccines should not be administered to patients while on immunomodulatory therapy.
