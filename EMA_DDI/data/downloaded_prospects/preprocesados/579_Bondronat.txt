4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Metabolic  interactions are not considered likely , since  ibandronic acid does not inhibit the major human hepatic P450 isoenzymes and has been shown  not to induce the hepatic cytochrome P450 system in rats  (see section 5.2). Ibandronic acid is eliminated by renal excretion only and does not undergo any biotransformation . 
 Caution is advised when bisphosphonates are administered with aminoglycosides, since both substances can lower serum calcium levels for prolonged periods. Attention should also be paid to the possible existence of simultaneous hypomagnesaemia.
