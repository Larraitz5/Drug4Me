4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No interaction studies have been performed related to the use of miglustat.  
 Food interaction  Miglustat is known to have a direct effect on the enzymatic function of major disaccharidases of the intestinal epithelium. Specifically, miglustat inhibits disaccharidases with alpha -glycosidic linkages including su crase, maltase, and isomaltase. The strength of potential interactions can immediately interfere with digestive activity of sucrose, maltose and isomaltose leading to maldigestion, osmotic influx of water, increased fermentation, and production of irritati ng metabolites. Patients should fast for 2 hours before and for 2  hours after taking miglustat .
