4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 In vitro  studies have demonstrated a very low potential for interaction with other medicinal products and protein binding interactions (see section  5.2). 
 Prostaglandin analogues  
 There are very limited data on the concomitant use of prostaglandin analogues and NEVANAC. Considering their mechanism of action, the concomitant use of these medicinal products is not recommended.  
 Concomitant use of topical NSAIDs and topical steroids may increase the potential for healing problems. Concomitant use of NEVANAC with medications that prolong bleeding time may increase the risk of haemorrhage  (see section  4.4).
