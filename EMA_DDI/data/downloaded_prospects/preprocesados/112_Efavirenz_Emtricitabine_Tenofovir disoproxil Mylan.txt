4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms o f interaction  
 As Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan contains efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil, any inter actions that have  been identifie d with these agents individually may occur with Efavirenz/Emtricitabi ne/Tenofovir dis oproxil Mylan. Interaction studies with these agents have only been performed in adults. 
 As a fixed combination, efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disop roxil should not be administered concomitantly with other  medicinal products containing the comp onents, emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil. Efavirenz/emtricita bine/tenofovir d isoproxil should  not be co-administe red with products containing efavirenz unless needed for dose adjustment e.g. wit h rifampicin (see se ction 4.2). Due to similarities with emtricitabine, efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofo vir disoproxil should not be administered concomitantly with o ther cytidine analogues, such as lamivudine. Efavirenz/emtricitabi ne/tenofovir disoproxil should not be admi nistered concomita ntly with adefovir dipivoxil or with medicinal produc ts containing tenofovir alafe namide. 
  
11 Efavirenz is an  in vivo  inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and UGT1A1. Compounds that are subst rates of these enzymes may have decreased plasma concentrations when co- administered with efavirenz. Efavirenz may be an inducer of CYP2C19 and CYP2C9; however, inh ibition has also been observed in vitro  and the net effect of co-adminis tration with substrates of the se enzymes is not clear (see section 5.2). 
 Co-administration of e favirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoprox il with metamizole, which is an inducer of metabolising enzymes including CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 may  cause a reduction in plasma concentrations of efavirenz/emtr icitabine/tenofovir disoproxil with potential decrease in clinical efficacy. Therefore, caution is advised when metamizole and efa virenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil are adminis tered concurrently; clinical response and /or medicinal product levels should be monitored as a ppropriate.  
 Efavirenz exposure may be increased when given with medicinal p roducts (for example ritonavir) or food (for example, grapefruit juice) which inhibit CYP3A4 or CY P2B6 activity. Comp ounds or herbal preparations (for example Ginkgo biloba extracts and St. John's  wort) which induce these enzymes may give rise to decreased plasma concentrations of efavirenz. Concomitant use of St. John's wort is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Concomitant use of Ginkgo bi loba extracts is not recommended (see section 4.4). 
 In vitro  and clinical pharmacok inetic interaction st udies have shown th e potential for CYP-mediated interactions involving emtricita bine and tenofovir disoproxil w ith other medicinal  products is low. 
 Cannabinoid test interaction 
 Efavirenz does not bind to cannabinoid receptors. False-positiv e urine cannabinoid test results have been reported with some screening assays in uninfected and HIV infected subjects receiving efavirenz. Confirmatory testing by a more specific method such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry is recommended in such cases. 
 Contraindications of concomitant use 
 Efavirenz/emtricitabi ne/tenofovir disoproxil must not be admini stered concurrently  with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, midazolam,  triazolam, pimozide, bepridil , or ergot alkaloids (for example, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, and methylergonovine ), since inhibition of their metabolism may lead to serious, life-threatening events (see se ction 4.3). 
 Elbasvir/grazoprevir:  Co administration of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disopro xil with elbasvir/grazoprevir is contraindicated because it may lead to loss of virologic response to elbasvir/grazoprevir (see section 4.3 and Table 1). 
 Voriconazole:  Co-administration of standard doses of efavirenz and voriconaz ole is contraindicated. Since efavirenz/emtric itabine/tenofovir disoproxil is a fixed-d ose combination product, the dose of efavirenz cannot be altered; therefore, voriconazole and efavir enz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil must not be co-administered (see section 4.3 and Table 1). 
 St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum):  Co-administration of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil and St. John's wort or herbal preparations containin g St. John's wort is contraindicated. Plasma levels of efavirenz can be reduced by concomitant use of  St. John's wort due to induction of medicinal product metabolising en zymes and/or transport protein s by St. John's wort. If a patient is already taking St. John's wort, stop St. John's wort, check vir al levels and if possible efavirenz levels. Efavirenz levels may increase on stopping St. John's wort. The inducing effect of St. John's wort may persist for at least 2 weeks after cessation of treatment (see section 4.3).  
12  QT Prolonging medicinal products: efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil is contraindicated  with concomitant use of medicinal products that are known to pr olong the QTc interval and could lead to Torsade de Pointes, such as: antiarrhythmics of classes IA a nd III, neuroleptics and antidepressant agents, certain antibiotics includ ing some agents of the follow ing classes: macrolides, fluoroquinolones, imidazole, and triazole antifungal agents, ce rtain non-sedating antihistaminics (terfenadine, astemizole), cisapr ide, flecainide, certain antim alarials and methadone (see section 4.3).  
 Concomitant use not recommended 
 Atazanavir/ritonavir:  Insufficient data are availabl e to make a dosing recommendatio n for atazanavir/ritonavir in combina tion with efavirenz/emtricitabin e/tenofovir disoproxil. Therefore co-administration of ataza navir/ritonavir and efavirenz/emtricitab ine/tenofovir disoproxil is not recommended (see Table 1). 
 Didanosine:  Co-administration of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disopro xil and didanosine is not recommended (see Table 1). 
 Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir and sofo sbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir: Co-administration of efavirenz/emtricitabi ne/tenofovir disoproxil and sofosbuvir/vel patasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir is not recommended (see sec tion 4.4 and Table 1). 
 Praziquantel: Concomitant use of efavirenz with  praziquantel is not recommend ed due to significant decrease in plasma concentrations  of praziquantel, with risk of  treatment failure due to increased hepatic metabolism by efavirenz. In case the combination is nee ded, an increased dose of praziquantel could be considered. 
 Renally eliminated medicinal products:  Since emtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily eliminated by the kidneys, co-administration o f efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenof ovir disoproxil with medicinal products that reduce renal function or com pete for active tubular secret ion (e.g. cidofovir) may increase serum concentrations of emtr icitabine, tenofovir and/or the co-admini stered medicinal products. 
 Use of efavirenz/emtricitabine/te nofovir disoproxil should be a voided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic medicinal product. Some examples include, but are  not limited to, aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, foscarnet, gancic lovir, pentamidine, vancomycin , cidofovir or interleukin-2 (see section 4.4).

NRTIs and NNRTIs NRTIs/Efavirenz  Specific interaction st udies have not been performed with efavirenz and NRTIs other than lamivudine, zidovudine and tenofovir disoproxil. Clinically significant interactions have not been found and would not be expected since the NRTIs are metabolised via a different route than efavirenz and would be unlikely to compete for the same metabolic enzymes and elimination pathways.  Due to the similarity between lamivudine and emtricitabine, a component of efavirenz/emtric itabine/tenofovir disoproxil, efavirenz/emtric itabine/tenofovir disoproxil should not be administered concomitantly with  lamivudine (see section 4.4).  NNRTIs/Efavirenz  Interaction not studied.  Since use of two NN RTIs proved not beneficial in terms of efficacy and safety, co-admin istration of efavirenz/emtric itabine/tenofovir disoproxil and another NNRTI is not recommended.
