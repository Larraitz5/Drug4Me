4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 No clinical interaction studies have been performed. Difelikefalin does not inhibit or induce CYP450 enzymes, and is not a substrate of CYP450 enzymes. It is not an inhibitor of glucuronidating enzym es either. Difelikefalin is not a substrate or an inhibitor of human transporters (see section  5.2). Therefore, interactions of difelikefalin with other medicinal products are unlikely.  5 Concurrent administration of medicinal products such as sedating antihistamines , opioid analgesics or  other CNS  depressant s (e.g., clonidine, ondansetron, gabapentin, pregabalin, zolpidem, alprazolam, sertraline, trazodone)  may increase the likelihood of dizziness and somnolence (see section 4.4).
