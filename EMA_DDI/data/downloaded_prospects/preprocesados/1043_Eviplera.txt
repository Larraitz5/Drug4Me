4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 As Eviplera contains emtricitabine, rilpivirine hydrochloride and tenofovir disoproxil, any interactions that have been identified with these active substances individually may occur with Eviplera.  Interaction studies with these active substances have only been performed in adults.  
 Rilpivirine is primarily metabolised by CYP3A  Medicinal products that induce or inhibit CYP3A may thus affect the clearance of rilpivirine (see section  5.2). 
 Concomitant use contraindicated  
 Co-administration of Eviplera and medicinal products that induce CYP3A has been observed to decrease the plasma concentrations of rilpivirine which could potentially lead to loss of therapeutic effect of Eviplera (see section  4.3). 
 Co-administration of Ev iplera with proton pump inhibitors has been observed to decrease the plasma concentrations of rilpivirine (due to an increase in gastric p 
 H) which could potentially lead to loss of therapeutic effect of Eviplera (see section  4.3). 
 Concomitant use not recommended  
 Eviplera should not be administered concomitantly with other medicinal products containing emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil or tenofovir alafenamide.  Eviplera should not be administered concomitantly with rilpivirine hydrochloride unless neede d for dose adjustment with rifabutin (see section  4.2). 
 Due to similarities with emtricitabine, Eviplera should not be administered concomitantly with other cytidine analogues, such as lamivudine (see section  4.4).  Eviplera should not be administered concomitantly with adefovir dipivoxil.  
 Didanosine  The co -administration of Eviplera and didanosine is not recommended (see section  4.4 and Table  1). 
 Renally eliminated medicinal products  Since emtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily eliminated by the kidneys, co -administration of Eviplera with medicinal products that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion (e.g. cidofovir) may increase serum concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir and/or the co-administered medicinal products.  
 9 Use of Eviplera should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic medicinal product.  Some examples include, but are not limited to, aminoglycosides, amphotericin  B, foscarnet, ganciclovir, pentamidine, vancomycin, cidofovir or interleukin-2 (a lso called aldesleukin).  
 Other NNRTIs It is not recommended to co -administer Eviplera with other NNRTIs.  
 Concomitant use where caution is recommended  
 Cytochrome P450 enzyme inhibitors  Co-administration of Eviplera with medicinal products that inhibit CY P3A enzyme activity has been observed to increase rilpivirine plasma concentrations.  
 QT prolonging medicinal products  Eviplera should be used with caution when co-administered with a medicinal product with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes.  There is limited information available on the potential for a pharmacodynamic interaction between rilpivirine and medicinal products that prolong the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram.  In a study of healthy subjects, supratherapeutic doses of rilpivirine (75  mg once daily and 300 mg once daily) have been shown to prolong the QTc  interval of the ECG (see section  5.1). 
 P-glycoprotein substrates Rilpivirine inhibits P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in vitro  (IC
50 is 9.2  µM).  In a clinical study rilpivirine did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin.  However, it may not be completely excluded that rilpivirine can increase the exposure to other medicinal products  transported by P- gp that are more sensitive to intestinal P-gp inhibition (e.g. dabigatran etexilate). 
 Rilpivirine is an in vitro  inhibitor of the transporter MATE-2K with an IC 50 of < 2.7 n 
 M.  The clinical implications of this finding are currently unknown.  
 Other interactions 
 Interactions between Eviplera or its individual component(s) and co-administered medicinal products are listed in Table  1 below (increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓” and no change as “↔”).

Co-administration of Eviplera and didanosine is not recommended (see section  4.4). 
 Increased sy stemic exposure to didanosine may increase didanosine related adverse reactions.  Rarely, pancreatitis and lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, have been reported.  Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine at a dose of 400  mg daily has been associated with a significant decrease in CD4+ cell count, possibly due to an intracellular interaction increasing phosphorylated (i.e. active) didanosine.  A decreased dosage of 250 mg didanosine co-administered with tenofovir disoproxil therapy has been associated with reports of high rates of virological failure within several tested combinations for the treatment of HIV -1 infection.
