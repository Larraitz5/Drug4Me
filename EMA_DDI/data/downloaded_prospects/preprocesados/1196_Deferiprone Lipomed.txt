4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products a nd other forms o f interaction  
 Due to t he unknown mechanism of deferiprone-induced neutropenia, pat ients must not take medicinal products known to be assoc iated with  neutropenia or those that can cause agranulocytosis (see section 
4.3). 6  Since deferiprone binds to metalli c cations, the potentia l exists for interactio ns between defer iprone and trivalent cation -dependent medicinal products such as aluminium-ba sed antaci ds. Therefore, it is not re commended to conc omitantly ingest aluminium- based antacids and d eferiprone.  
 The safety of concurrent use of deferiprone and vitamin C has not been formally studie d. Based on the reported adverse interaction that can oc cur betwee n deferoxamine and vitamin C, caution should be used when administering deferiprone and vitamin C concurren tly.
