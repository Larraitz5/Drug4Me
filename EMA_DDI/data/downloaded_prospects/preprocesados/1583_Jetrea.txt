4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and  other forms of interaction  
 No formal interaction studies hav e been performed.  
 Ocriplasmin is a proteolytic enzym e with serine protease activity which could be present in the eye for several days after intravitreal injection (see section  5.2). Administra tion in close temporal association with other medicinal produc ts in the same eye may affect the activity of both me dicinal products and is therefore not recommended.  
 There are no clinical data on concomitant use of ocriplasmin with VEGF -inhibitors (vascul ar endothelial growth factor)  and therefore it is not recommen ded.  
 No systemic interactions are anticipated.
