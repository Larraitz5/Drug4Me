4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 Children a nd adolescents under 18 years of age receiving salicylate therapy should avoid vaccination with Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 Astra 
 Zeneca (see section 4.4). Use of salicylates in children and adolescents for 4weeks after vaccination should be avoided unless medically indicated as Reyeâ€™s syndrome has been reported following the use of salicylates during wild -type influenza infection.The co -administration of Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 Astra 
 Zeneca with inactivated vaccines or with the seasonal vaccine Fluenz Tetra has not been studied.Data regarding c o-administration of the seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine live, intranasal (T/LAIV )with live attenuated vaccines (measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) , varicella vaccine , and orally -administered poliovirus )are available and suggest that concomitant admininstration of Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 Astra 
 Zeneca with these live vaccines may be acceptable. Based upon the potential for infl uenza antiviral agents to reduce the effectiveness of Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 Astra 
 Zeneca , it is recommended not to administer the vaccine until 48hours after the cessation of influenza antiviral therapy. Administration of influenza antiviral agen ts within two weeks of vaccination may affect the response of the vaccine.If influenza antiviral agents and Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 Astra 
 Zeneca are administered concomitantly, timing and the need for revaccination should be considered based on cl inical judgement.
