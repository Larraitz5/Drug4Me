4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No interaction studies have been performed.  
 The effect of alternate -day administration of 250  microgram (8.0  million  IU) Extavia on drug metabolism in multiple sclerosis patients is unknown. Corticosteroid or ACTH treatment of relapses for periods of up to 28  days has been well tolerated in patients receiving Ext avia.  
 Due to the lack of clinical experience in multiple sclerosis patients, the use of Extavia together with immunomodulators other than corticosteroids or ACTH is not recommended.  
 Interferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochr ome P450 -dependent enzymes in humans and animals. Caution should be exercised when Extavia is administered in combination with medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic cytochrome P450 system for clear ance, e.g. anti -epileptics. Additional caution should be exercised with any co -medication which has an effect on the haematopoetic system.
