4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  9  The metabolism of paclitaxel is catalysed, in part, by cyt ochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 (see se ction 5.2). Therefore , in the absence o f a PK drug -drug inte raction study , caution should be exercised when administering paclitaxel concomitantly with medicines known to inhibit ei ther CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 (e.g . ketoconaz ole and other imidazole antifungals,  erythromycin, fluoxetine,  gemfibrozil, clopidogrel, cimetidin e, ritonavir, saquinavir, indinavir,  and nelfinavir ) because toxicity of paclitaxel may be increased due to higher paclit axel exposure. Administeri ng paclitax el concomitantly with medicines known  to induce either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 (e.g.  rifampicin, carbamaz epine, phenytoin, efavirenz, nevirapine) is not recommended because efficacy may be compromised because of lower paclitax el exposur es. 
 Paclitaxel and gemcitabine do not share a common metabolic p athway. Paclitaxel clearance is primari ly determined by CYP 2C8 and CYP 3A4 mediated metabolism followed by biliary excretion, while gemcitabine is inactivated by cytidine deaminase f ollowed by urinary excreti on. Pharmacokinetic interactions between Abraxan e and gemcitabine have not been evaluate d in humans.  
 A pharm acokinetic study was conducted with Abraxane and carboplatin in non- small cell lung cancer patients. There were no clinically relevant pharmacokine tic interactions between Abraxane and carboplati n. 
 Abraxane is indicated as monotherapy for breast cancer , in combination with gemcitabine for pancreatic adenocarcinoma, or in combination with carboplatin for non-small cell lung  cancer  (see section 4.1) . Abraxane sh ould not be used in combination with o ther anticancer agents.   
 Paediatric po pulation  Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.
