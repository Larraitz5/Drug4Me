4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Effect of other medicinal products on rucaparib  
 Enzymes responsible for rucaparib metabolism have not been identified. Based on in vitro  data, CYP2D6, and to a lesser extent CYP1A2 and CYP 3A4, were able to metabolize rucaparib.  Although in vitro  rucaparib metabolism mediated by CYP3A4 was slow, a significant contribution of CYP3A4 in vivo  cannot be excluded. Caution should be used for conc omitant use of strong  CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers.  
 In vitro , rucaparib was shown to be a substrate of P -gp and BCRP. Effect of P -gp and BCRP inhibitors on rucaparib PK cannot be ruled out. Caution is recommended when rucaparib is co-administered with medicinal products that  are strong inhibitors of P -gp. 
 Effects of rucaparib on other medicinal products  
 In medicinal product interaction studies in cancer patients, the effects of steady -state rucaparib at 
600 mg twice daily on CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A, BCRP and P -gp were evaluated with single oral doses of sensitive probes (caffeine, S -warfarin, omeprazole, midazolam, rosuvastatin, and digoxin, respectively). The effect of rucaparib on the pharmacokinetics of the combined oral contraceptive (ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel) was also evaluated. Data suggest that rucaparib is a moderate inhibitor of CYP1A2, and a mild inhibitor of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A. Rucaparib also marginally inhibits P -gp and weakly inhibits BCRP in the gut.  
 CYP1A2 subs trates  Rucaparib showed no effect on Cmax of caffeine while moderately increas ing AUC inf of caffeine by 
2.55 fold (90% CI: 2.12, 3.08). W hen co- administering medicinal products metabolized by CYP1A2, particularly medicines which have a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., tizanidine, theophylline) , dose adjustments may be considered  based on appropriate clinical monitoring . 
 CYP2C9 substrates  Rucaparib increased S -warfarin C max by 1.05 fold (90% CI: 0.99 to 1.12) and AUC 0-96 h by 1.49 fold (90% CI: 1.40 to 1.58), respectively . When co- administering medicinal products that  are CYP2C9 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., warfarin, phenytoin) , dose  adjustments may be considered, if clinically indicated. C aution should be exercised and additional International Normalised Ratio (INR) monitoring with co -administration  of warfarin  and therapeutic drug level monitoring of phenytoin should be considered , if used concomitantly with rucaparib.  
 CYP2C19 substrates  Rucaparib increased omeprazole Cmax by 1.09 fold (90% CI: 0.93 to 1.27) and AUC inf by 1.55 fold (90% CI: 1.32 to 1.83) . The risk for a clinically relevant effect of concomitant administration of proton pump inhibitors ( PPIs) is likely small (see section 5.2). No dose adjustment is considered necessary for co -administered medicinal products that are CYP2C19 substrates.  
 
6 CYP3A substrates  Rucaparib increased midazolam C max by 1.13 fold (90% CI: 0.95 to 1.36) and AUC inf by 1.38 fold (90% CI: 1.13 to 1.69). Caution is advised when co- administering medicinal products that are CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., alfentanil, astemizole, cisapride, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, terfenadine). Dose adjustments may be considered, if clinically indicated based on observed adverse reactions.  
 Oral contraceptives  Rucaparib increased ethinylestradiol C max by 1.09 fold (90% CI: 0.94 to 1.27) and AUC last by 1.43 fold (90% CI: 1.15 to 1.77). Rucaparib increased lev onorgestrel C max by 1.19 fold (90% CI: 1.00 to 1.42) and AUC last by 1.56 fold (90% CI: 1.33 to 1.83). No dose adjustment is recommended for co-administered oral contraceptives.  
 BCRP substrates  Rucaparib increased rosuvastatin C max by 1.29 fold (90% CI: 1.07 to 1.55) and AUC inf by 1.35 fold (90% CI: 1.17 to 1.57). No dose adjustment is recommended for co- administered medicinal products that are BCRP substrates.  
 P-gp substrates  Rucaparib showed no effect on Cmax of digoxin while mar ginally increasing AUC 0-72 h by 1.20 fold (90% CI: 1.12 to 1.29). No dose adjustment is recommended for co- administered medicinal products that are P -gp substrates.  
 Interaction of rucaparib with other enzymes and transporter was evaluated in vitro . Rucapa rib is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYP2D6, and UGT1A1. Rucaparib down regulated CYP2B6 in human hepatocytes at clinically relevant exposures. Rucaparib is a potent inhibitor of MATE1 and MATE2 -K, a moderate inhibitor of OCT1, and a weak inhibitor of OCT2. As inhibition of these transporters could decrease metformin renal elimination and decrease liver uptake of metformin, caution is advised when metformin is co- administered  with rucaparib. The clinical relevance of UGT1A1 inhibition by rucaparib is not clear. Caution should be used when rucaparib is co-administered with UGT1A1 substrates (i.e. irinotecan) to patients with UGT1A1*28 (poor metabolizer) due to a possible increase in the  exposur e of SN -38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan)  and associated toxicities.
