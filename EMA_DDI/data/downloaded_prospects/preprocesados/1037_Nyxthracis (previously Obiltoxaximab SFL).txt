4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Ciprofloxacin  
 In an interaction study, a single dose of obiltoxaximab was given alone or co- adminis tered with ciprofloxacin in 40 subjects . Twenty subjects received obiltoxaximab alone and 20 subjects received obiltoxaximab plus ciprofloxacin for 9 days. The administration of 16 mg/kg obiltoxaximab intravenous infusion prior to ciprofloxacin intravenous  infusion or ciprofloxacin twice daily oral tablet ingestion did not alter the pharmacokinetics of obiltoxaximab. Likewise, obiltoxaximab did not alter the pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin administered orally  or intravenously.  
 No other interaction studie s have been performed . Since obiltoxaximab is a monoclonal antibody, the risk of interaction is low.
