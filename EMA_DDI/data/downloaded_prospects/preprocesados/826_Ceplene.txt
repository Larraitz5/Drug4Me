4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 While posology differs, when Ceplene is used in conjunction with IL -2, physicians should also refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics ( Sm 
 PC ) for IL -2 and observe the respective medic inal product interactions.  
 H2 receptor antagonists with im idazole structures similar to histamine, e.g., cimetidine, systemic steroids and clonidine, must not be used during treatment with Ceplene (see section  4.3). 
 Beta-blockers and other anti -hypertensive agents should be used with caution during treatment wit h Ceplene.  C oncurrent administration of medicinal products with cardiotoxicity or blood pressure lowering effects may increase the toxicity of Ceplene.  
 7 H1 receptor blocking antihistamines or neuroleptics (anti -psychotics) with H 1 receptor blocking proper ties that might decrease efficacy of Ceplene should be avoided.  
 Tricyclic anti -depressants may have H 1 and H 2 receptor blocking properties and should be avoided.  
 Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, anti -malarial, and anti -trypanosomal active substances may alter the metabolism of Ceplene and should be avoided (see section  4.4). 
 It has been noted that neuromuscular blocking agents, narcotic analgesics, and various contrast media can induce the release of endogenous histamine; therefore in patients undergoing  diagnostic or surgical procedures, the additive effect of Ceplene treatment should be considered prior to the procedure (see section  4.4).
