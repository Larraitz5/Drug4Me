4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 The co -administration of Tovanor  Breezhaler with other anticholinergic -containing medicinal products has not been studied and is therefore  not recommended.  
 Although no formal drug interaction studies have been performed, Tovanor  Breezhaler has been used concomitantly with other medicinal products  commonly used in the treatment of COPD without clinical evidence of drug interactions. These include sympathomimetic b ronchodilators, meth ylxanthines, and  oral and inhaled steroids.  
 In a clinical study in healthy volunteers, cimetidine, an inhibitor of organic cation transport which is thought to contribute to the renal excretion of glycopyrronium, increased total exposure (AUC) to glycopyr ronium by 22% and decreased renal clearance by 23%. Based on the magnitude of these changes, no clinically relevant drug interaction is expect ed when glycopyrronium  is co-administered with cimetidine or other inhibitors of organic cation transport.  
 Concom itant administration of glycopyrronium  and orally inhaled indacaterol, a beta 2-adrenergic agonist, under steady -state conditions of both active substances did not affect the pharmacokinetics of either medicinal product.
