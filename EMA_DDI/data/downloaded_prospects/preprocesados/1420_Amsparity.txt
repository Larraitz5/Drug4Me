4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Adalimumab  has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic arthritis patients taking adalimumab  as monotherapy and those taking concomitant methotrexate. Antibody formation was lower when adalimumab  was given toget her with methotrexate in comparison with use as monotherapy. Administration of adalimumab  without methotrexate resulted in increased formation of  antibodies, increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab (see section  5.1). 
 The combination of Amsp arity and anakinra is not recommended (see section  4.4 “Concurrent administration of biologic DMARDS or TNF -antagonists”).  
 The combination of Amsparity  and abatacept is not recommended (see section  4.4 “Concurrent administration of biologic DMARDS or TNF -antagonists”).
