4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Currently, there are limited data on possible drug interactions with rituximab.  
 In CLL patients, co- administration with rituximab  did not appear to have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of fludarabine or cyclophosphamide. In addition, there was no apparent effect of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide on the pharmacokinetics of rituximab . 
 Co-administration with methotrexate had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of rituximab  in rheumatoid arthritis patients.  
 Patients with human anti- mouse antibody (HAMA) or anti -drug antibody (ADA) titres may have allergic or hypersensitivity reactions when treated with other diagnostic or therapeutic monoclonal antibodies.  
 In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 283 patients received subsequent therapy with a biologic DMARD following rituximab . In these patients the rate of clinically relevant infection while on rituximab  was 6.01 per 100 patient years compared to 4.97 per 100 patient years following treatment with the biologic DMARD.
