4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 No interaction studies have been performed. Based on its metabolism, laronidase is an unlikely candidate for Cytochrome P450 mediated interactions.   Aldurazyme should not be administered simultaneously with chloroquine or procaine due to a potential risk of interference with the intracellular uptake of laronidase.
