4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 There are no known interactions with other medicinal products. No interaction studies have been performed. 
 Growth factor treatment such as G-CSF must not be given to patients for 3 weeks prior to Zevalin administration as well as for 2 weeks following completion of the treatment (see also section 4.4).  
 In a clinical trial in which Zevalin was administered as consolidation after prior first line chemotherapy, a higher frequency of severe and prolonged neutropenia and thrombocytopenia was observed in patients who had received Zevalin within 4 months after a combination chemotherapy of fludarabine with mitoxantrone and/or cyclophosphamide compared to those patients who had received any other chemotherapy. Hence the risk of haematological toxicity may be increased when Zevalin is administered shortly (< 4 months) after fludarabine-containing regimens (see also section 4.4). 
 The safety and efficacy of immunization with any vaccine, particularly live viral vaccines, following therapy with Zevalin have not been studied (see also section ‘Special warnings and precautions for use’)
