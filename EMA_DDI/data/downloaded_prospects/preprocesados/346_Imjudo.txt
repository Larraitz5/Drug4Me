4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 The use of systemic corticoster oids or immunosuppressants before starting tremelim umab , except physiological dose of systemic corticosteroids ( â‰¤ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent),  is not recommended because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy 11 of tremelim umab. However, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used after  starting tremelim umab  to treat immune -related adverse reactions (see section 4.4).  
 No formal pharmacokinetic (PK) drug -drug interaction studies have been conducted with tremelimuma b. Since the primary elimination pathways of tremelimu mab are protein catabolism via reticuloendothelial system or target -mediated disposition , no metabolic drug -drug interactions are expected.  PK drug -drug interactions betwe en tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab and platinum -based chemotherapy were assessed in the POSEIDON study and showed no clinically meaningful PK interactions between tremelimumab, durvalumab, nab -paclitaxel, gemcitabine, pemetrexed, carboplatin or  cisplatin in the concomitant treatment.
