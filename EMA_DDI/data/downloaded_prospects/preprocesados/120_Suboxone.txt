4.5 Interaction with other  medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Buprenorphine/ naloxone should not be ta ken t ogether with:  
 
• Alcoholic drinks or medicin al products containing al cohol, as alcohol increases the sedative  effect of buprenorphine (s ee section 4.7). 
 Suboxone should be used cautiously when co- administered with:  
 
• Sedatives such  as benzodiazepines or related medicinal products The concomitant use of opioids with sedative medicinal products  such as benzodiazepin es or related med icinal p roducts  increases the risk of sedation, respiratory depressio n, coma and death because of additive CNS depressant effect. The dose and duration of concomitant use of sedative medicinal produ cts should be limited (see section 4.4). P atients should b e warned  that it is extremely dangerous to self -administer non -prescribed benzodiazepines while taking t his medicinal product and  should also be cautioned to use benzodiazepines concurrently with this medicinal product only as directed by their physician (s ee sect ion 4.4). 
 
• Other central nerv ous system depressants, other opioid derivatives (e .g. methadone, a nalgesics and antit ussives), certain antid epressants,  sedative H 1-receptor antagonists, ba rbiturates, anxiolyt ics other than benzodiazep ines, neurolepti cs, clonidi ne and related substances:  these combinations increase central nervous system  depression. The  reduced level of ale rtness can make driving and using ma chines hazardous. 
 
• Furthermore , adequ ate analgesia m ay be difficult to achieve  when administerin g a full o pioid agonist in patients receiving buprenorphine/naloxone. Therefore the pot ential to overdo se with a full agonis t exists, especially when  attempting  to overcome buprenorphine pa rtial agonist effects, or when buprenorphine plasm a levels are declining.  
 
• Serotonergic medicinal products , such as MAO inhibitors , selec tive serotonin re -uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serot onin norepine phrine re -uptake inhibitor  (SNR Is) or tricycli c 9 antidepress ants as the risk of serotonin syndrome, a pot entially life -threatening co ndition, is increased (see section 4.4). 
 
• Naltrexone and nalmefene are opioid antagonists that can block the pha rmacolog ical effects of buprenorphine. Co- administration during bup renorphine/na loxone treatment is contraindicated due to the potent ially dange rous interaction that may  precipitate a sudden onset of prolonged and intense opioid withdraw al symptoms (see section 4.3). 
 
• CYP3A4 inhibitors: an interaction study of buprenor phine with ketoconazole (a potent inhibitor of CYP3A 4) resulted in in creased C max and AUC (area under the  curve) of buprenorphine (approximately 50 % and 70 % respectively) and, to a lesser ex tent, of  norbuprenorphine. Patients receivin g Suboxone should be  closely mo nitor ed, and may require dose -reduction i f combined with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. protease inhibitors like ritonavir, nelfinavir or indinavir or azole antifungals such as ketoconazole or itraconazole, macrolide antibioti cs).  
 
• CYP3A4 induc ers: Concom itant use of CYP3A4 inducers with buprenor phine may decrea se buprenor phine plasma concentrations, potentially resulting in sub- optimal treatment of opioid depende nce with buprenorphine. It is recommended that patients receiving buprenorphine/naloxone should be closely monitored if inducers (e.g. phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin) are co -administered. The dose of buprenorphine or the CYP3A4 inducer may need to be adj usted ac cordingly.  
 
• The concomitant use of  monoamine oxidase i nhibitors (M AOI)  might produce exaggeration of the ef fects of opioids,  based on e xperience with morphine.
