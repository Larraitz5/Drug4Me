4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Based on in vitro  data, azacitidine metabolism does not appear to be mediated by cytochrome  P450 isoenzymes (CYPs), UDP -glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), sulfotransferases (SULTs), and glutathione transferases (GSTs); interactions related to these metabolizing enzymes in vivo  are therefore considered unlikely.  
 Clinically significant inhibitory or inductive effects of azacitidine on cytochrome P450 enzymes are unlikely (see section  5.2). 
 No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted.
