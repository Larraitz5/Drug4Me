4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 In clinical studies, zoledronic acid has been administered concomitantly with commonly used anticancer agents, diuretics, antibiotics and analgesics without clinically apparent interactions occurring. Zoledronic acid shows no appreciable binding to plasma proteins and does not inhibit human P450 enzymes in vitro (see section  5.2), but no formal clinical interaction studies have been performed.   7 Caution is advised when bisphosphonates are administered with aminoglycosides , calcitonin or loop diuretics , since these agents may have an additive effect, resulting in a lower serum calcium level for longer periods than required (see section 4.4).  
 Caution is indicated when Zoledronic Acid Teva is used with other potentially nephrotoxic medicinal products. At tention should also be paid to the possibility of hypomagnesaemia developing during treatment.  
 In multiple myeloma patients, the risk of renal dysfunction may be increased when Zoledronic Acid Teva is used in combination with thalidomide.  
 Caution is advi sed when Zoledronic Acid Teva  is administered with anti- angiogenic medicinal products as an increase in the incidence of ONJ has been observed in patients treated concomitantly with these medicinal products.
