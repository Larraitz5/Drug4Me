4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  6  Metabolic  interactions  are not considered likely, since ibandronic  acid does not inhibit the major  human hepatic  P450 isoenz ymes and has been shown  not to induce  the hepatic  cytochrome  P450 system in rats (see section 5.2). Ibandronic acid is eliminated by renal excretion only and does not undergo any biotransformation. 
 Caution is advised  when  bisphosph onates are administered  with aminoglycosides,  since  both substances can lower  serum  calci um levels for prolonged  periods. Attention  should also be paid to the possible  existence  of simultaneous  hypomagnes aemia.
