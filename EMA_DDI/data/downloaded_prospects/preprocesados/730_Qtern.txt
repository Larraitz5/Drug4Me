4.5 Interaction with other medic inal products and other forms of interaction 
 Pharmacodynamic interactions 
 Diuretics 
 Dapagliflozin may add to the diuretic effect of thiazide and loop diuretics and may increase the risk of dehydration and hypotension (see section 4.4).Use with medicinal products known to cause hypoglycaemia 
 If this medicinal product is used in combination with insulin secretagogue (sulphonylurea), a reduction in the dose of sulphonylurea may be required to minimi se the risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4).Pharmacokinetic interactions 
 Saxagliptin: Themetabolismofsaxagliptinisprimarilymediated by cytochrome 
 P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5). Dapagliflozin: The metabolism of dapagliflozin is primarily via glucuronide conjugation mediated by UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1A9 (UGT1A9).Interactions with other oral anti -diabetic or cardiovascular medicinal products 
 Saxagliptin: Saxagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharm acokinetics of dapagliflozin, metformin, glibenclamide, pioglitazone , digoxin, diltiazem or simvastatin . These medicinal productsdid not alter the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin or its m ajor active metabolite.Dapagliflozin: Dapagliflozin did not meaningfully alter the pharm acokinetics of saxagliptin, metformin, pioglitaz one, sitagliptin, glimepiride, voglibose , hydrochlorothiazide, bumetanide, valsartan, or simvastatin . These medic inalproducts did not alter the pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin.Effect of other medicinal products on saxagliptin or dapagliflozin 
 Saxagliptin: Conco mitant administration of saxagliptin with the moderateinhibitor of CYP3 A4/5 diltiazem, increasedthe 
 Cmaxand A UC of sa xagliptinby63% a nd 2.1 -fold, r espectively, and thecorresponding values fortheactivemetabol iteweredecreasedby44% and 34%, respectively.These pharmacokinetic effects are not clinically meaningful and do not require dose adjustment.8Conco mitant administration of saxagliptin with the potentinhibitor of 
 CYP3A4/5 ketocona zole, increasedthe 
 Cmaxand A UC of sa xagliptinby62% a nd 2.5 -fold, r espectively, and the corresponding values fortheactivemetabol iteweredecreasedby95% and 88%, respectively.These pharmacokinetic effects are not clinically meaningful and do not require dose adjustment.Conco mitant administration of saxagliptin with the potent 
 CYP3A4/5 inducerrifampicin reduced Cmaxand AUC of saxagliptin by 53% and 76%, respectively. The exposureofthe activemetabol iteand the plasma 
 DPP-4 activityinhibitionoveradoseintervalwerenotinfluencedbyrifampicin(see section4.4).Thecoadministration ofsaxagliptin and CYP3A4/5 inducers, other than rifampicin (such as carbamazepine,dexa methasone, p henobarbital and phenytoin)hasnotbeen studiedand mayresultin decreasedplasmaconc entrationofsaxagliptinandincreased concentrationofitsmajormetabolite. Glycaemiccontrolshouldbecarefullyassessedwhen saxagliptinisused concomitantlywithapotent CYP3A4/5inducer.In studi escond ucted in hea lthysubjects,neitherthepharmacokineticsofsaxagliptinnoritsmajormetabolitewere meaningfullyalteredbymetformin,gliben clamide,pioglitazone, digoxin, simvastatin,omeprazole, ant acidsorfamotidine.Dapagliflozin: Following coadministration of dapagliflozin with rifampicin (an inducer of various active transporters and drug -metabolising enzymes) a 22% decrease in dapagliflozin systemic exposure (AUC) was observed, but with no clinically meaningful effect on 24 -hour urinary glucose excretion. No dose adjustment is recommended. A clinically relevant effect with other inducers (e.g. carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital) is not expected.Following coadministration of dapagliflozin with mefenamic acid (an inhibitor of UGT1A9), a 55% increase in dapagliflozin systemic exposure was seen, but w ith no clinically meaningful effect on 
24-hour urinary glucose excretion.Effect of saxagliptin or dapagliflozin on other medicinal products 
 Saxagliptin: Saxagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glibenclamide(a CYP2C9 substrate) , pioglitazone [a CYP2C8 (major) and CYP3A4 (minor) substrate ], digoxin (a P-gpsubstrate) , simvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate) , the active components of a combined oral contraceptive (ethinylestradiol and norgestimate), dilt iazem  or keto conazole.Dapagliflozin: In interaction studies conducted in healthy subjects, using mainly a single -dose design, dapagliflozin did not alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, pioglitazone [a CYP2C8 (major) and CYP3A4 (minor) substrate] , sitagliptin, glimepiride (a CYP2C9 substrate) , hydrochlorothiazide, bumetanide, valsartan, digoxin (a P -gp substrate) or warfarin (S -warfarin, a CYP2C9 substrate), or the anticoagulatory effects of warfarin as measured by INR. Combination of a single dose of dapagliflo zin 
20mgand simvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate) resulted in a 19% increase in AUC of simvastatin and 
31% increase in AUC of simvastatin acid. The increase in simvastatin and simvastatin acid exposures are not considered clinically relevant .Interference wi th 1,5 -anhydroglucitol (1,5 -AG) assay 
 Monitoring glyc aemic control with 1,5 -AG assay is not recommended as measurements of 1,5 -AG are unreliable in assessing glyc aemic control in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Use of alternative methods to monitor glyc aemic control is advised .
