4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 In all clinical trials, individuals who had received immunoglobulin or blood-derived products duringthe 6  months prior to the first vaccine dose were excluded. Use with other vaccines Administration of Gardasil  at the same time (but, for injected vaccines, at a dif ferent injection site) ashepatitis B (recombinant) vaccine did not interf ere with the immune response to the HPV types. Theseroprotection rates (proportion of individuals reaching seroprotective level anti
-HBs >10 m 
 IU/ml)were unaf fected (96.5
 % for concomitant vaccination and 97.5
 % for hepatitis B vaccine only). Anti
-HBs geometric mean antibody titres were lower on co
-administration, but the clinical significance ofthis observation is not
 known.  5Gardasil may be administered concomitantly with a combined booster vaccine containing diphtheria(d) and tetanus (T) with either pertussis [acellular, component] (ap) and/or poliomyelitis [inactivated](IPV) (d 
 Tap, d 
 T
-IPV, d 
 Tap -IPV vaccines) with
 no signif icant interf erence with antibody response toany of the components of either vaccine. However, a trend of lower anti
-HPV GMTs was observed inthe concomitant group. The clinical significance of this observation is not known. This is based on theresults from a clinical trial in which a combined d 
 Tap
-IPV vaccine was administered concomitantlywith the first
 dose of Gardasil (see section
 4.8).The concomitant administration of Gardasil with vaccines other than the ones above has not beenstudied.Use with hormonal contraceptives 
 In clinical studies
, 57.5  % of women aged 16 to 26
 years a nd 31.2  % of women aged 24 to 45
 yearswho received Gardasil used hormonal contraceptives during the vaccination period. Use of  hormonalcontraceptives did not appear to af fect the immune response to Gardasil.
