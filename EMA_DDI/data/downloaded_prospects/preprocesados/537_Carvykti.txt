The co-administration of agents known to stimulate T cell function has not been investigated and theeffects are unknown.Some patients in the clinical trials o n 
 CARVYKTI required tocilizumab ,corticosteroids and anakinrafor management of CRS . CARVYKTI continues to expand and persist following tocilizumab administration. In Study MMY2001, p atients treated with tocilizumab (n=6 8) had 81% and 72% higher CARVYKTI Cmaxand AUC 0-28d, respectively, as compared to patients (n= 29) who did not receive tocilizumab. Patients who received corticosteroids (n=28) had 75% and 112% higher C maxand AUC 0-28d, respect ively, compared with patients who did not receive corticosteroids (n=69). In addition, patients who received anakinra (n=20) had 41% and 7 2% higher C maxand AUC 0-28d,respectively, compared with patients who did not receive anakinra (n=77). In Study MMY300 2, the results related to tocilizumab and corticosteroid were consistent with Study MMY2001.Live vaccines 
 The safety of immuni sation with live viral vaccines during or following CARVYKTI treatment has not been studied. As a precautionary measure, v accination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 6 weeks prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy ,during CARVYKTI treatment, and until immune recovery following treatment with CARVYKTI.
