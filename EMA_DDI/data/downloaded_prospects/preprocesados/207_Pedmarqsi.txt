4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Sodium thiosulfate  should only be given at least 6  hours after the end of cisplatin infusion . Sodium thiosulfate should not be given  when cisplatin  is infused for longer than 6 hours  or if a subsequent cisplatin  infusion is planned within 6  hours  (see section  4.2). The delayed administration prevents potential interfere nce with cisplatin chemotherapy efficacy  against the tumour . 
 No other interaction studies have been performed . Relevant pharmacokinetic interactions are unlikely as administration of thiosulfate is infrequent , only in  conjunction with cisplatin  and thiosulfate is rapidly eliminated within hours after administration.  Sodium thiosulfate potentially induces CYP2B6 (see section  5.2).
