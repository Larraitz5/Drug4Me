4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction   
 Shingrix can be given concomitantly with unadjuvanted inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine ,  
23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) , 13-valent pneum ococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) , reduced antigen diphtheria -tetanus -acellular pertussis vaccine (d 
 Tpa) , or coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID -19) messenger ribonucleic acid (m 
 RNA) vaccine. The vaccines should be administered at different injection sites.  
 In  five  phase III, controlled, open- label clinical studies, adults â‰¥  50 years of age were randomised to receive 2 doses of Shingrix 2 months apart administered either concomitantly at the first dose or non-concomitantly with an unadjuvanted inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine (N=828; Zoster -004), a PPV23 vaccine (N=865; Zoster -035), a PCV13 vaccine (N=912; Zoster -059), a d 
 Tpa vaccine formulated with 0.3 milligrams Al
3+ (N=830; Zoster -042), or a monovalent COVID- 19 m 
 RNA -1273 
50 micrograms  booster vaccine  (Original SARS -Co 
 V -2 strain ) (N=5 39; Zoster -091). The immune responses of the co -administered vaccines were unaffected, with the exception of lower geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) for one of the pertussis antigens (pertactin) when Shi ngrix is co-administered with the d 
 Tpa vaccine. The clinical relevance of this data is not known.  
 The adverse reactions of fever and shivering were more frequent when PPV23 vaccine  was co-administered with Shingrix  (16% and 21%, respectively) compared to when Shingrix was given alone (7% for both adverse reactions) . 
 In adults aged 50 years and above, systemic adverse reactions that are very commonly reported (see Table 1 ; such as myalgia 32.9%, fatigue 32.2%, and headache 26.3% ), and arthralgia, uncommonly reported, following administration of Shingrix alone were reported with increased frequency when Shingrix was co- administered with a COVID -19 m 
 RNA vaccine  (myalgia 64%, fatigue 51.7%, headache 39%, arthralgia 30.3% ).  
 Concomitant us e with other vaccines than those listed above  is not recommended due to lack of data .
