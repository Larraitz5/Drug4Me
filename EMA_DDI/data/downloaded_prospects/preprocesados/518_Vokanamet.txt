4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with Vokanamet have not been performed; however, such studies have been conducted with the individual active substances (canagliflozin and metformin).Co-administration of canagliflozin (300 mg once daily) and metformin (2 ,000mg once daily) had no clinically r elevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of either canagliflozin or metformin.Canagliflozin 
 Pharmacodynamic interactions 
 Diuretics 
 Canagliflozin may add to the effect of diuretics and may increase the risk of dehydration and hypotension (see section 4.4).Canagliflozin is not recommended for use in patients receiving loop diuretics.Insulin and insulin secretagogues 
 Insulin and insulin secretagogues, such as sulphonylureas, cancause hypoglycaemia. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or an insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with Vokanamet (see sections 4.2 and 4.8) .Pharmacokinetic interactions 
 Effects of other medi cinal products on canagliflozin 
 The metabolism of canagliflozin is primarily via glucuronide conjugation mediated by UDP glucuronosyl transferase 1A9 (UGT1A9) and 2B4 (UGT2B4). Canagliflozin is transported by P-glycoprotein (P -gp)and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) .Enzyme inducers (such as St. Johnâ€™s wort [ Hypericum perforatum ], rifampicin, barbiturates, phenytoin, carbamazepine, ritonavir, efavirenz) may give rise to decreased exposure of canagliflozin. Following co -administration of canagliflozin with rifampicin (an inducer of various active transporters 10and medicinal product -metaboli sing enzymes), 51% and 28% decreases in canagliflozin systemic exposure ( area under the curve, AUC) and peak concentration (C max) were obs erved. These decreases in exposure to canagliflozin may decrease efficacy.If a combined inducer of these UGT enzyme s and transport proteins must be co -administered with canagliflozin , monitoring of glycaemic control to assess response to canagliflozin is appropriate. If an inducer of these UGT enzymes must be co -administered with canaglif lozin, increasing the dose to Vokanamet containing 15 0mg twice daily may be considered if patients are currently tolerating canagliflozin 5 0mg twice daily and requi re additional glycaemic control (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).Cholestyramine may potentially reduce canagliflozin exposure. Dosing of canagliflozin should occur at least 1 hour before or 4 -6hours after administration of a bile acid sequestrant to minimise pos sible interference with their absorption.Interaction studies suggest that the pharmacokinetics of canagliflozin are not altered by metformin, hydrochlorothiazide, oral contraceptives (ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrol), ciclosporin, and/or probenecid.Effects of canagliflozin on other medicinal products 
 Digoxin 
 The combination of canagliflozin 300 mg once daily for 7 days with a single dose of digoxin 0.5 mg followed by 0.25 mg daily for 6 days resulted in a 20% increase in AUC and a 36% increase in Cmaxof digoxin, probably due to inhibition of P -gp. Canagliflozin has been observed to inhibit P -gp in vitro . Patients taking digoxin or other cardiac glycosides (e.g., digitoxin) should be monitored appropriately.Lithium 
 The concomitant use of an SGLT2 inhibitor with lithium may decrease serum lithium concentrations. Monitor serum lithium concentration more closely during treatment with c anagliflozin , especially during initiation and dosage changes.Dabigatran 
 The effect of concomitant administration of canagliflozin (a weak P -gp inhibitor) on dabigatran etexilate (a P -gp substrate) has not been studied. As dabigatran concentrations may be increased in the presence of canagliflozin, monitoring (looking for signs of bleedin g or anaemia) should be exercised when dabigatran is combined with canagliflozin.Simvastatin 
 The combination of canagliflozin 300 mg once daily for 6 days with a single dose of simvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) 40 mg resulted in a 12% increase in AUC and a 9%increase in C maxof simvastatin and an 18% increase in AUC and a 26% increase in C maxof simvastatin acid. The increases in simvastatin and simvastatin acid exposures are not considered clinically relevant .Inhibition of BCRP by canagliflozin cannot be excluded at an intestinal level and increased exposure may therefore occur for medicinal products transported by BCRP, e.g. ,certain statins like rosuvastatin and some anti -cancer medicinal products .In interaction studies, canagliflozin at steady -state had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin, oral contraceptives (ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrol), glibenclamide, paracetamol, hydrochlorothiazide, or warfarin.Medicinal product /laboratory test interference
1,5-AG assay 
 Increases in urinary glucose excretion with canagliflozin can falsely lower 1,5 -anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) levels and make measurements of 1,5 -AG unreliable in assessing glyc aemic control. 11Therefore, 1,5 -AG assays should not be used for assessment of glyc aemic control in patients on Vokanamet. For further detail, it may be advisable to contact the specific manufacturer of the 1,5 -AG assay.Metformin 
 Concomitant use not recommended 
 Alcohol 
 Alcohol intoxication is associated with anincreased risk of lactic acidosis (particularly in case sof fasting, malnutrition ,or hepatic impairment ) due to the metformin active substance of Vokanamet (see section 4.4). Consumption of alcohol and medicinal products containing alcohol should be avoided.Iodinated contrast agents 
 The intravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents in radiological studies may lead to renal failure, resulting in metformin accumulation and a risk of lactic acidosis. Therefore, Vokanamet must be discontinu ed prior to, or at the time of the imaging procedure and not restarted until at least 
48hours after, provided that renal function has been re -evaluated and found to be stable (see section s4.2 and 4.4).Cationic medicinal products 
 Cationic medicinal products that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion (e.g., cimetidine) may interact with metformin by competing for common renal tubular transport systems. A study conducted in seven normal healthy volunteers showed that cimetidine, administered as 400 mg twice daily, increased metformin AUC by 50% and C maxby 81%. Therefore, close monitoring of glycaemic control, dose adjustment within the recommended posology and changes in diabetic treatment should be considered when cationic medicinal products that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion are co-administered ( seesections 4.4 and 5.1).Combinations requiring precautions for use 
 Some medicinal products can adversely affect renal function which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, e.g. NSAIDs, including selective cyclo -oxygenase (COX) II inhibitors, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and diuretics, especially loop diuretics. When starting or using such products in combination with Vokanamet , close monitoring of renal function is necessary.Glucocorticoids (given by systemic and local routes) ,beta-2-agonists, and diuretics have intrinsic hyperglyc aemic activit y. The patient should be informed and more frequent blood glucose monitoring performed, especially at the beginning of treatment with such medicinal products. If necessary, the dose of glucose -lowering medicinal product s should be adjusted during therapy w ith the other medicinal product and on its discontinuation.Due to their potential to decrease renal function, diuretics (especially loop diuretics) may increase the risk of lactic acidosis associated with metformin.
