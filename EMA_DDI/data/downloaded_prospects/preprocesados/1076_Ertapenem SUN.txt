4.5 Interaction with other medicinal pr oducts and other fo rms of interaction  
 Interactions caused by inhibition of P-glycoprotein-mediated cleara nce or CYP-mediated clearance of medicinal products are unlikely (see section 5.2). 
 Decreases in valproic acid levels that may fall be low the therapeutic range have been reported when valproic acid was co-administered with carbapenem ag ents. The lowered valproic  acid levels can lead to inadequate seizure control; th erefore, concomitant use of ertapenem and valproic acid/sodium valproate is not recommended and alternative antib acterial or anti-convulsant therapies should be considered.
