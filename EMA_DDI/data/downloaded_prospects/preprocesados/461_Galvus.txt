4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Vildagliptin has a low potential for interactions with co -administered medicinal products. Since vildagliptin is not a cytochrome P (CYP) 450 enzyme substrate and does not inhibit or induce CYP 
450 enzymes, it is not likely to interact with active substances that are substrates, inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes.  
 Combination with pioglitazone, metformin and glyburide  
 Results from studies conducted with these oral ant idiabetics have shown no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions.  
 Digoxin (Pgp substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate)  
 Clinical studies performed with healthy subjects have shown no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions. However, this  has not been established in the target population.  
 Combination with amlodipine, ramipril, valsartan or simvastatin  
 Drug -drug interaction studies in healthy subjects were conducted with amlodipine, ramipril, valsartan and simvastatin. In these studies, no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed after co -administration with vildagliptin.  
 Combination with ACE -inhibitors  
 There may be an increased risk of angioedema in patients concomitantly taki ng ACE -inhibitors.(see sectio n 4.8). 
 As with other oral antidiabetic medicinal products the hypoglycaemic effect of vildagliptin may be reduced by certain active substances, including thiazides, corticosteroids, thyroid products and sympathomimetics.
