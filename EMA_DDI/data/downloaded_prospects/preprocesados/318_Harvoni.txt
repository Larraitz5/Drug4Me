4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products a nd other forms of interaction  
 As Harvoni contains ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, any interactions that have been identified with these active substances individually may occur with Harvoni.  
 Potential for Harvoni to affect other medicinal products  
 Ledipasvir  is an in  vitro  inhibitor of drug transporter P -gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and may increase intestinal absorption of co -administered substrates for these transporters.   
 Potential for other medicinal products to affect Harvoni  
 Ledipasvir and sofosbuvir are substrates of drug transporter P -gp and BCRP while GS -331007 is not.  
 Medicinal products that are strong P -gp inducers (carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin, rifabutin and St. John’s wort) may significantly decr ease ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plasma concentrations leading to reduced therapeutic effect of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and thus are contraindicated with Harvoni (see section  4.3). Medicinal products that are moderate P -gp inducers in the intestine (e.g. oxcar bazepine) may decrease ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plasma concentrations leading to reduced therapeutic effect of Harvoni.  Co-administration with such medicinal products is not recommended with Harvoni (see section  4.4). Co-administration with medicinal prod ucts that inhibit P- gp and/or BCRP may increase ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plasma concentrations without increasing GS -331007 plasma concentration; Harvoni may be co-administered with P -gp and/or BCRP  inhibitors.  Clinically significant medicinal product interactions with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir mediated by CYP450s or UGT1A1 enzymes are not expected.  
 Patients treated with vitamin  K antagonists  
 As liver function may change during treatment with Harvoni, a close monitoring of International Normalised Ratio (INR) values is recommended.  
 Impact of DAA therapy on drugs metabolized by the liver  
 The pharmacokinetics of drugs that are metabolized by the liver (e.g. immunosuppressive agents such as calcineurin inhibitors) may be impacted by changes in liver functi on during DAA therapy, related to clearance of HCV virus.  
 Interactions between Harvoni and other medicinal products  
 Table  6 provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant medicinal product interactions (where 90% confidence inter val [CI] of the geometric least -squares mean [GLSM] ratio were within “↔”, extended above “↑”, or extended below “↓” the predetermined equivalence boundaries).  The medicinal product interactions described are based on studies conducted with either ledipasv ir/sofosbuvir or ledipasvir and sofosbuvir as individual agents, or are predicted medicinal product interactions that may occur with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir.  The table is not all -inclusive.

 The safety of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in the setting of Harvoni and a pharmacokinetic enhancer (e.g. ritonavir or cobicistat) has not been established.  
 The combination should be used with caution with frequent renal monitoring, if other alternatives are not available (see section  4.4). Dolutegravir  Interaction not studied.  Expected:

 A REDUCTASE INHIBITORS  Rosuvastating ↑ Rosuvastatin  
 (Inhibition of drug transporters OATP and BCRP)  Co-administration of Harvoni with rosuvastatin may significantly increase the concentration of rosuvastatin (several fold -increase in AUC) which is associated with increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis. Co- administration of Harvoni with rosuva statin is contraindicated (see section  4.3). Pravastating ↑ Pravastatin  Co-administration of Harvoni with pravastatin may significantly increase the concentration of pravastatin which is associated with increased risk of myopathy. Clinical and biochemical  control is recommended in these patients and a dose adjustment may be needed (see section  4.4). 18 Medicinal product by therapeutic areas  Effects on medicinal product levels.
