4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 Co-administration of  Rota 
 Teq with vaccines containing one or more of the following antigens atapproximately 2, 4 and 6
 months of  age demonstrated that the immune responses and the saf etyprof iles of  the administered vaccines were unaf f ected:
- Diphtheria -tetanus -acellular pertussis vaccine (DTa 
 P)
- Haem ophilus influenzae
 type b vaccine (Hib)
- Inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine (IPV)
- Hepatitis B vaccine (HBV)
- Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV)Co-administration of  Rota 
 Teq with DTa 
 P
-IPV-HBV -Hib vaccine (Inf anrix hexa) at approximately 2,
3, and 4  months o f  age demonstrated that the immune responses and the safety prof iles of  theco-administered vaccines were unaf f ected compared to separate administrations.Co-administration of  Rota 
 Teq with a group
 C meningococcal conjugate vaccine (Men 
 CC, the vaccinestudied was a tetanus toxoid conjugate) at 3 and 5
 months of age (and mostly at the same time as 
 DTa 
 P -IPV-Hib vaccine), followed by a third dose of  Rota 
 Teq at approximately 6
 months of age,demonstrated that the immune responses to Rota 
 Teq and Men 
 CC were unaf fected. Co-administrationresulted in an acceptable saf ety prof ile.Concomitant administration of  Rota 
 Teq and oral poliomyelitis vaccine (OPV) did not af f ect theimmune response to the poliovirus antigens. Although concomitant administration of  OPV slightlyreduced the immune response to rotavirus vaccine, there is currently no evidence that clinicalprotection against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis would be af f ected. The immune response to Rota 
 Teqwas unaf f ected when OPV was administered two weeks af ter Rota 
 Teq.Theref ore, Rota 
 Teq can be given concomitantly with monovalent or combination inf ant vaccinescontaining one or more of the following antigens: DTa 
 P, Hib, IPV or OPV, HBV, PCV and Men 
 CC.
