4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 No interaction studies have been performed in humans.  
 Leptin is a cytokine and has the potential to alter the formation of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes. Since it cannot be excluded that metreleptin  may reduce exposure to substrates of CYP3A through enzyme induction, the efficacy of hormonal  contraceptives may be reduced if co -administered  with metreleptin (see section 4.6). Therefore, an additional non-hormonal contraceptive method should be considered during treatment.  The effect of metreleptin on CYP450 enzymes may be clinically relevant for CYP450 substrates with  narrow therapeutic index, where the dose is individually adjusted. Upon initiation or discontinuation of metreleptin, in patients being treated with these types of agents, therapeutic monitoring of effect (e.g., warfarin), or drug concentrations (e.g. cyc losporin or theophylline) should be performed and the individual dose of the agent adjusted as needed. When starting therapy with Myalepta there is a risk of hypoglycaemia in patients who are on anti -diabetic medicinal products, in particular insulin or insulin secretagogues (see section 4.4).
