4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Due to the potential sensitivity of rapidly dividing myeloid cells to cytotoxic chemotherapyâ€š pegfilgrastim should be administered at least 24 hours after administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy. In clinical studies , pegfilgrastim has been safely administ ered 14 days before chemotherapy. 6Concomitant use of pegfilgrastim with any chemotherapy agent has not been evaluated in patients. In animal models concomitant administration of pegfilgrastim and 5- fluorouracil (5 -FU) or other antimetabolites has been shown to potentiate myelosuppression. Possible interactions with other haematopoietic growth factors and cytokines have not been specifically investigated in clinical studies . The potential for interaction with lithium, which also promotes the release of n eutrophils, has not been specifically investigated. There is no evidence that such an interaction would be harmful. The safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim have not been evaluated in patients receiving chemotherapy associated with delayed myelosuppression e.g. nitrosoureas. Specific interaction or metabolism studies have not been performed, however, clinical studies have not indicated an interaction of pegfilgrastim with any other medicinal products.
