4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with STELARA.Administration of live vaccines (such as the BCG vaccine) to infants exposed in utero to ustekinumab is not recommended for six months following birth or until ustekinumab infant serum levels are undetectable (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). If there is a clear clinical benefit for the individual infant, administration of a live vaccine might be considered at an earlier timepoint, if infant ustekinumab serum levels are undetectable.No interaction studies have been performed in humans. In the po pulation pharmacokinetic analyses of the phase 3studies, the effect of the most frequently used concomitant medicinal products in patients with psoriasis (including paracetamol, ibuprofen, acetylsalicylic acid, metformin, atorvastatin, levothyroxine) on p harmacokinetics of ustekinumab was explored. There were no indications of an interaction with these concomitantly administered medicinal products. The basis for this analysis was that at least 100 patients (> 5% of the studied population) were treated conc omitantly with these medicinal products for at least 90% of the study period. The pharmacokinetics of ustekinumab was not impacted by concomitant use of MTX, NSAIDs , 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine and oral corticosteroids in patients with psoriatic arthrit is, Croh n’s disease or ulcerative colitis , or prior exposure to anti -TNFα agents, in patients with psoriatic arthritis or Crohn’s disease or by prior exposure to biologics (i.e. anti -TNFα agents and/or vedolizumab) in patients with ulcerative colitis .Theresults of an in vitro study do not suggest the need for dose adjustments in patients who are receiving concomitant CYP450 substrates (see section 5.2).In psoriasis studies, the safety and efficacy of STELARA in combination with immunosuppressants, including biologics, or phototherapy have not been evaluated. In psoriatic arthritis studies, concomitant MTX use did not appear to influence the safety or efficacy of STELARA . In Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis studies, concomitant use of immunosuppres sants or corticosteroids did not appear to influence the safety or efficacy of STELARA (see section 4.4).
