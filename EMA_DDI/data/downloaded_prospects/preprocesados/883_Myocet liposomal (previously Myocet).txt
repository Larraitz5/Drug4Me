4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products  and other forms of interactions  
 6 Specific medicinal product compatibility studies have not been performed with Myocet  liposomal . Myocet  liposomal  is likely to interact with subs tances that are known to interact with conventional doxorubicin. Plasma levels of doxorubicin and its metabolite, doxorubicinol, may be increased when doxorubicin is administered with cyclosporin, verapamil, paclitaxel or other agents that inhibit P -glycop rotein (P -Gp). Interactions with doxorubicin have also been reported for streptozocin, phenobarbital, phenytoin and warfarin. Studies of the effect of Myocet  liposomal on other substances are also lacking. However, doxorubicin may potentiate the toxicity o f other antineoplastic agents. Concomitant treatment with other substances reported to be cardiotoxic or with cardiologically active substances (e.g. calcium antagonists) may increase the risk for cardiotoxicity. Concomitant therapy with other liposomal or  lipid-complexed substances or intravenous fat emulsions could change the pharmacokinetic profile of Myocet  liposomal .
