4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Nitisinone is metabolised in vitro  by CYP3A4 and dose-adjustment may therefore be needed when nitisinone is co- administered with inhibitors or inducers of this enzyme.  
 Based on data from a clinical interaction study with 80 mg nitisinone at steady- state, nitisinone is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C9 (2.3-fold increase in tolbutamide AUC), therefore nitisinone treatment may result in increased plasma concentrations of co- administered medicinal products metabolized primarily via CYP2C9 (see section 4.4). 5 Nitisinone is a weak inducer of CYP2E1 (30 % decrease in chlorzoxazone AUC) and a weak inhibitor of OAT1 and OAT3 (1.7- fold increase in AUC of furosemi de), whereas nitisinone did not inhibit CYP2D6 (see section 5.2). 
 A food effect study has been conducted with Nityr . The study demonstrated that Nityr can be administered with or without food without affecting its bioavailability.
