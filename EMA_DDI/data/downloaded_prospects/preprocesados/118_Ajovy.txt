4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 No formal clinical drug interaction studies have been performed with AJOVY. No pharmacokinetic drug interactions are expected based on the characteristics of fremanezumab. Furthermore, concomitant use of acute migraine treatments (specifically analgesics, ergots, and triptans) and migraine preventive medicinal products during the clinical studies did not affect the pharmacokinetics of fremanezumab.
