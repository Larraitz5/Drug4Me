4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Co-administration of aclidinium b romide with other anticholinergic -containing medicinal produc ts has not been studied and is not recommended.  
 Although no formal in vivo drug interacti on studies have been performed , inhaled aclidinium bromide has been used concomitantly with other COPD me dicinal products including sympathomimetic bronchodilators, m ethylxanthines, and oral and inhaled steroids without clinical evidence of drug interactio ns. 4  In vitro  studies have shown that aclidinium bromide or the metabolites of aclidinium bromide at the therapeutic dose are not expected to cause interactions with active substances that are substrates of P-glycoprotein ( P-gp) or active substances  metabo lised by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes  and esterases (see section 5.2).
