4.5 Interaction with other medic inal products and other  forms of interaction  
 Limited published data indicate that growth hormone treatment increases cytochrome P450 mediated antipyrine clearance in man. Monitoring  is advisable when  somatropin is administered in combination with medicinal products known to be metabolised by CYP450 liver enzymes, such as corticosteroids, sex s teroids, anticon vulsants, and c yclosporin. 
 In patients treated with somatropin, pre viously undiagnosed central  (secondar y) hypoadrenalism may be unmasked requiring glucocorticoid replacement therapy. In addition, patients treated with glucocortoco id replacement therapy for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in the ir maintenance or s tress doses, follo wing initiation of somatropin treat ment (see section 4.4). 
 In patients with diabetes mellitus requiring drug therapy, the dose of  insulin and/or oral hypoglycemic medicinal product may require adjustment when somatropin therapy is initiated (see section 4.4). 6  
  In women on oral oestrogen replacement , a higher dose of growth hormone may be required to achieve the treatment goal (see section 4.4).
