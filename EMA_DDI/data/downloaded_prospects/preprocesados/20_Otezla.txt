4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Co-administration of strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme inducer, rifampicin, resulted in a reduction of systemic exposure of apremilast, which may result in a loss of efficacy of apremilast. Therefore, the use of strong CYP3A4 enzyme inducers (e.g. rifampicin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin and St. Johnâ€™s Wort) with apremilast is not recommended. Co -administration of apremilast with multiple doses of rifampicin resulted in a decrease in apremilast area -under -the-concentration time curve (AUC ) and maximum serum concentration (C max) by approximately 72% and 43%, respectively. Apremilast exposure is decreased when administered concomitantly with strong inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g. rifampicin) and may result in reduced clinical response.  
 In clinica l studies, apremilast has been administered concomitantly with topical therapy (including corticosteroids, coal tar shampoo and salicylic  acid scalp preparations) and UVB phototherapy.  
 There was no clinically meaningful interaction between ketoconazole an d apremilast. Apremilast can be co -administered with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor such as ketoconazole.  
 There was no pharmacokinetic interaction between apremilast  and methotrexate in psoriatic arthritis patients. Apremilast can be co -administered with methotrexate.  
 There was no pharmacokinetic interaction between apremilast and oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol and norgestimate. Apremilast can be co -administered with oral contraceptives.
