4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Sympathomimetic medicinal products  
 Concomitant administration of other sympathomimetic medicinal products  (alone or as part of combination therapy) may potentiate adverse reactions to  Oslif  Breezhaler . 
 Oslif  Breezhaler  should not be used in conjunction w ith other long -acting beta 2-adrenergic agonists or medicinal products containing long -acting beta 2-adrenergic agonists.  
 Hypokalaemi c treatment  
 Concomitant hypokalaemic treatment with methylxanthine derivatives, steroids, or non -potassium -sparing diuretics may potentiate the possible hypokalaemic effect of beta 2-adrenergic agonists , therefore caution is required  (see section  4.4). 5  Beta-adrenergic blockers  
 Beta-adrenergic blockers and beta 2-adrenergic agonists may weaken or antagonise the effect of each other when administered concurrently. Therefore indacaterol should not be given together with beta -adrenergic blockers (including eye drops) unless there are compelling reasons for their use.  Where required, cardioselective beta -adrenergic blockers should be preferred, although they should be administered with caution.  
 Metabolic and transporter based interaction s 
 Inhibition of the key contributors of indacaterol clearance, CYP3A4 and P -glyco protein (P -gp) raises the systemic exposure of indacaterol by up to two -fold. The magnitude of exposure increases due to interactions does not raise any safety concerns given the safety experience of treatment with Oslif  Breezhaler  in clinical studies of up to one year at doses up to twice the maximum recommended therapeutic dose . 
 Indacaterol  has not been shown to cause interactions with medicinal products administered concomitantly . In vitro  investigations have indicated that indacaterol has negligible p otential to cause metabolic interactions with medic inal products  at the systemic exposure levels achieved in clinical practice.
