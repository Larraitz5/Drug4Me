4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 The risk of a potential intera ction between Novo 
 Seven and coagulation factor concentrates is unknown. Simultaneous use of prothrombin complex concentrates, activated or not, should be avoided.  
 Antifibrinolytics have been reported to reduce blood loss in association with surgery in hae mophilia patients, especially in orthopaedic surgery and surgery in regions rich in fibrinolytic activity, such as the oral cavity . Antifibrinolytics are also used to reduce blood loss in women with postpartum haemorrhage.  Experience with concomitant admin istration of antifibrinolytics and r 
 FVIIa treatment is , however , limited. 
 Based on a non-clinical study (see section 5.3) it is not recommended to combine r 
 FVIIa and r 
 FXIII. There are no clinical data available on interaction between r 
 FVIIa and r 
 FXIII.
