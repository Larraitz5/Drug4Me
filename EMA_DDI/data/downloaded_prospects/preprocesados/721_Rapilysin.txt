4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No interaction studies have been performed. Retrospective analyses of clinical studies did not reveal any clinically relevant interactions with medicinal product used concomitantly with reteplase in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Heparin, vitamin K antagonists and medicinal product that alter platelet function (such as acetylsalicylic acid, dipyridamole and abciximab) may increase the risk of bleeding if administered prior to, during or after reteplase therapy. 
 Attention should be paid to this effect especially during periods of low plasma fibrinogen (up to about 
2 days after fibrinolytic therapy of AMI). 
 For information on product incompatibilities see section 4.2.
