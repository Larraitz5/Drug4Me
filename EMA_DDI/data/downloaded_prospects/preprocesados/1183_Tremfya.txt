4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 Interactions with CYP450 substrates 
 In a Phase 1 study in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, changes in systemic exposures (Cmaxand AUC inf) of midazolam, S -warfarin, om eprazole, dextromethorphan, and caffeine after a single dose of guselkumab were not clinically relevant , indicating that interactions between guselkumab and substrates of various CYP enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2) are unlikely. There is no need for dose adjustment when co -administering guselkumab and CYP450 substrates.Concomitant immunosuppressive therapy or phototherapy 
 In psoriasis studies , the safety and efficacy of guselkumab in combination with immunosuppressants, including bi ologics, or phototherapy have not been evaluated.5
