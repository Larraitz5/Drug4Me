4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of  interaction   
 No interaction studies have been performed . Monoclonal antibod ies (m 
 Ab ) such as dostarlimab  are not substrates for cytochrome P450 or active substance  transporters. Dostarlimab is not a cytokine and is unlikely to be a cytokine modulator. Additionally, pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction of dostarlimab with small molecule active substances  is not e xpected. There is no evidence of interaction mediated by non-specific clearance of lysosome degradation for antibodies.
