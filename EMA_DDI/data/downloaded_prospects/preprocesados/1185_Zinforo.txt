4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 No clinical drug -drug interaction studies have been conducted with ceftaroline fosamil.The interaction potential of ceftaroline or ceftaroline fosamil on medicinal products metabolised by CYP450 enzymes is expected to be low since they are not inhibitors nor inducers of CYP450 enzymes in vitro . Ceftaroline or ceftaroline fosamil are not metabolised by CYP450 enzymes in vitro , therefore co-administered CYP450 inducers or inhibitors are unlikely to influenc e the pharmacokinetics of ceftaroline.Ceftaroline is neither a substrate, nor an inhibitor of renal uptake transporters (OCT2, OAT1, and OAT3) invitro . Therefore, interactions of ceftaroline with medicinal products that are substrates or inhibitors (e.g. probenecid) of these transporters would not be expected.Paediatric population 
 As with adults, the interaction potential is expected to be low in paediatrics.
