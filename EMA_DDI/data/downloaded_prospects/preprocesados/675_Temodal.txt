4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 In a separate phase  I study, administration of  TMZ with ranitidine did  not resul t in alterations in theextent of  absorption of
 temozolomide or the exposure to its active metabolite
 monomethyltriazenoimidazole carboxamide ( MTIC). Administration of  TMZ
 with f ood resul ted in a 33  
% decrease in Cmax and a 9  % decrease  in are a underthe curve (AUC). As it cannot be excluded that the cha nge in C max is clinically signif icant, Temodal should beadministered without f ood.Based on an analysis of
 population pharmaco kinetics in ph ase II trials, co -administration ofdexameth asone, prochlorpe razine, phenytoin, carbamazepine, ondansetron, H2 receptor antagonists, orphenobarbital did not alter the clearance of TMZ. Co-administration w ith valproic acid
 was associatedwith a small but statistically signif icant decrease in clearance of  T MZ.No st udies have been conducted to determine the ef f ect of  TMZ on the metabolism
 or elimination ofother me dicinal products. However
, since TMZ does not undergo hepatic metabolism and exh ibits lowprotein binding, it is unlikely that it would aff ect th e pharmaco kinetics of  other medicinal products(see secti on 5.2).Use of  TMZ in combination with other myelosuppressive agents may increase the likelihoo d ofmyelosuppression.
