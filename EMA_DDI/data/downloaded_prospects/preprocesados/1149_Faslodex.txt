4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 A clinical interaction study with midazolam (substrate of CYP3A4) demonstrated that fulvestrant does not inhibit CYP3A4. Clinical int eractio nstudies with rifampicin (inducer of CYP3A4) and ketoconazole (inhibitor of CYP3A4) showed no clinically relevant change in fulvestrant clearance. Dose adjustment is therefore not necessary in patients who are receiving fulvestrant and CYP3A4 inhib itors o rinducers concomitantly.
