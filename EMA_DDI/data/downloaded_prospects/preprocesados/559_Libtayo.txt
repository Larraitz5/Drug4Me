4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No pharmacokinetic (PK) drug -drug interaction studies have been conducted with cemiplimab.  The use of systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants before starting cemiplimab, except for physiological doses of systemic corticosteroid (â‰¤  10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent), should be avoided because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy of cemiplimab. However, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used after starting cemiplimab to treat immune -mediated adverse reactions (see section  4.2).
