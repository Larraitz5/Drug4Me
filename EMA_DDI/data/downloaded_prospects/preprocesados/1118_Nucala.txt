4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction   
 No interaction studies have been performed.  
 Cytochrome P450 enzymes, efflux pumps and protein- binding mechanisms are not involved in the clearance of mepolizumab. Increased levels of pro -inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL -6), via interaction with their cognate receptors on hepatocytes, have  been shown to suppress the formation of CYP450 7 
 enzymes and drug transporters, however, elevation of systemic pro- inflammatory markers in severe refractory eosinophilic asthma is minimal and there is no evidence of IL -5 receptor alpha expression on hepatoc ytes. The potential for interactions with mepolizumab is therefore considered low.
