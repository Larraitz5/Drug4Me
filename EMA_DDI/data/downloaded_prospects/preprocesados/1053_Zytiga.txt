4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 Effect of food on abiraterone 
 Administration w ith food significantly increases the absorption of abiraterone . The efficacy and safety when given with food have not been established therefore this medicinal product must not be taken with food (see sections 4.2 and 5.2) .Interactions with other medicin al products 
 Potential for other medicinal products to affect abiraterone exposures 
 In a clinical pharmacokinetic interaction study of healthy subjects pretreated with a strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin, 600 mg daily for 6 days followed by a single dose of abiraterone acetate 1000mg, the mean plasma AUC âˆžof abiraterone was decreased by 55%.Strong inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, St John's wort [ Hypericum perforatum ]) during treatment a re to be avoided, unless there is no therapeutic alternative.In a separate clinical pharmacokinetic interaction study of healthy subjects, co -administration of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmac okinetics of abiraterone .Potential to affect exposures to other medicinal products 
 Abiraterone is an inhibitor of the hepatic drug -metaboli sing enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP2C8.In a study to determine the effects of abiraterone acetate (plus prednisone) on a s ingle dose of the CYP2D6 substrate dextromethorphan, the systemic exposure (AUC) of dextromethorphan was increased approximately 2.9 fold. The AUC 24for dextrorphan, the active metabolite of dextromethorphan, increased approximately 33%.Caution is advise d when administer ingwith medicinal products activated by or metabolised by CYP2D6, particularly with medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index. Dose reduction of medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic index that are metabolised by CYP2 D6 should be considered. Examples of medicinal products metabolised by CYP2D6 include metoprolol, propranolol, desipramine, venlafaxine, haloperidol, risperidone, propafenone, flecainide, codeine, oxycodone and tramadol (the latter three medicinal products requiring CYP2D6 to form their active analgesic metabolites).In a CYP2C8 drug -drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, the AUC of pioglitazone was increased by 
46% and the AUCs for M -III and M -IV, the active metabolites of pioglitazone, each decrease d by 10% when pioglitazone was given together with a single dose of 1 000mg abiraterone acetate . Patients should be monitored for signs of toxicity related to a CYP2C8 substrate with a narrow therapeutic index if used concomitantly. Examples of medicinal product smetaboli sed by CYP2C8 include pioglitazone and repaglinide (see section 4.4).In vitro , the major metabolites abiraterone sulphate and N -oxide abiraterone sulphate were shown to inhibit the hepatic uptake transporter OATP1B1 and as a consequence it may increase the concentrations of medicinal products eliminated by OATP1B1. There are no clinical data available to confirm transporter based interaction.Use with products known to prolong QT interval 
 Since androgen deprivation treatment may prolong the QT interval, caution is advised when administering ZYT IGA with medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval or medicinal 7products able to induce torsade sde pointes such as class IA (e.g. quinidine, disopyramide) or class III (e.g. amiodarone, s otalol, dofetilide, ibutilide) antiarrhythmic medicinal products, methadone, moxifloxacin, antipsychotics, etc.Use with Spironolactone 
 Spironolactone binds to the androgen receptor and may increase prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels. Use with ZYTIGA is not recommended (see section 5.1).
