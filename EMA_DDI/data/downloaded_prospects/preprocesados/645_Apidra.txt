4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Studies on pharmacokinetic interactions have not been performed. Based on empirical knowledge from similar medicinal products, clinically relevant pharmacokinetic intera ctions are unlikely to occur. A number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of insulin glulisine and particularly close monitoring.  6 Substances that may enhance the blood -glucose-lowering activity and increase susceptibili ty to hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products , angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibioti cs. Substances that may reduce the blood-glucose- lowering activity include corticosteroids, danazol, diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, oestrogens , progestins (e.g. in oral contraceptives), protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic medicinal products (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either pot entiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering activity of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia, which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. In addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent.
