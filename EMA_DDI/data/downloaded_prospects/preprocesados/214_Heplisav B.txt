4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 As there are no data on co -administration of HEPLISAV B with other vaccines, the concomitant use of HEPLISAV  B with other vaccines is not recommended.  
 Concomitant administration of HEPLISAV  B with hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) has not been studied. However, in circumstances where HEPLISAV B is administered  with a standard dose of HBIG, these should be given at separate injection sites.
