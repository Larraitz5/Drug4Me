4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 Potential for Mavir etto affect other medicinal products 
 Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir are inhibitor sof P-glycopr otein (P -gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1/3. Co -administration with Maviretmay increase plasm a concentration sof medicinal products that are substrates of P -gp(e.g. dabigatran etexilate, digoxin), BCRP (e.g. rosuvastatin), or OATP1B1/3 (e.g. atorvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin). See Table 3 for spec ific recommendations on interactions with sensitive substrates of P -gp, BCRP, and OATP1B1/3. For other P -gp, BCRP, or OATP1B1/3 substrates, dose adjustment may be needed.Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir are weak inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A and uri dine glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 in vivo. Clinically significant increases in exposure were not observed for sensitive substrates of CYP3A (midazolam, felodipine) or UGT1A1 (raltegravir) when administered with Maviret.Both glecaprevir and pibrentas vir inhibit the bile salt export pump (BSEP) in vitro .Significant inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, UGT1A4, UGT2B7, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1 or MATE2K are not expected.Patients treated with vitamin K antagonists 
 As liver function may change during treatment with Maviret ,a close monitoring of International Normalised Ratio (INR) values is recommended.Potential for other medicina l products to affect Maviret 
 Use with strong P -gp/CYP3A inducers 
 Medicinal products that are strong P -gp and CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampicin, carbamazepine, St. John’s wort ( Hypericum perforatum ), phenobarbital, phenytoin, and primidone) could significantly decrease glecaprevir or pibrentasvir plasma concentrations and may lead to reduce d therapeutic effect of Maviret or loss of virologic response. Co -administration of such medicinal products with Maviret is contraindicated (see section 4.3).Co-administration of Maviret with medicinal products that are moderate inducers P -gp/CYP3A may decrease glecaprevir and pibrentasvir plasma concentrations (e.g. oxcarbazepine, eslicarbazepine, lumacaftor, crizotinib). Co -administration of moderate inducers isnot recommended (see section 4.4).Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir are substrates of the efflu x transporters P-gp and /or 
 BCRP . Glecaprevir is alsoa substrate of the hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1/3. Co -administration of Maviret with medicinal products that inhibit P-gp and BCRP (e.g. c iclosporin, cobicistat, dronedarone, itraconazole, ketoconazole, ritonavir) may slow elimination of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir and thereby increase plasma exposure of the antivirals. Medicinal products that inhibit OATP1B1/3 (e.g. elvitegravir, ciclosporin, darunavir, lopinavir) increase systemic concent rations of glecaprevir .6Established and other potential medicinal product interactions 
 Table 3provides the least-squares m ean Ratio (90% Confidence Interval) effect on concentration of 
 Maviret and some common concomitant medicinal products. The directio n of the arrow indicates the direction of the change in exposures (C max,AUC , and C min) in glecaprevir, pibrentasvir ,and the co-administered medicinal product (↑= increase (more than 25%), ↓ = decrease (more than 20%), ↔ 
= no change (equal to or less than 20% decrease or 25 %increase )). This is not an exclusive list. All interaction studies were performed in adults.Table 3: Interactions between Maviret and other medicinal products
