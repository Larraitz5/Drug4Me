4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 No interaction studies have been performed.The use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided in patients receiving tezepelumab .In a randomised, double blind, parallel group study of 70 patients aged between 12 and 21 years with moderate to severe asthma, tezepelumab treatment did not appear to affect the humoral antibody responses induced by seasonal quadrivalent influenza vaccination .A clinically relevant effect of tezepe lumab on the pharmacokinetics of co -administered asthma medicinal products is not expected. Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, commonly co-administered asthma medicinal products (including leukotriene receptor antagonists, theophylline/amino phylline and oral corticosteroids ) had no effect on tezepelumab clearance.
