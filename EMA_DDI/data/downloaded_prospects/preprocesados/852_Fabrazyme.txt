4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No interaction studies and no in vitro  metabolism studies have been performed. Based on its metabolism, agalsidase beta is an unlikely candidate for cytochrome P450 mediated drug -drug interactions.  
 Fabrazyme should  not be administered with chloroquine, amiodarone, benoquin or gentamycin due to a theoretical risk of inhibition of intra -cellular ÔÅ°-galactosidase  A activity.
