4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 No interaction studies have been performed.Talquetamab causes release of cytokines (see section 5.1) that may suppress activity of cytochrome P450 ( CYP )enzymes, potentially resulting in increased exposure of CYP substrates. The highest risk of drug -drug interaction is expected to occur from initiation of talquetamab step -up phase up to 9 days after the first treatment dose and during and after CRS (see s ection 4.4). Monitor for toxicity or concentrations of medicinal products that are CYP (e.g., CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4/5 , CYP2D6 )substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions. The dose of 12concomitant CYP (e.g., CYP2C9 , CYP2C19, CYP3A4/5 , CYP2D6 )substrate drug sshould be adjusted as needed.
