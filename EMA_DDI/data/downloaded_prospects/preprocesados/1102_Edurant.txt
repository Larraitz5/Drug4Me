4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products a nd other forms of interaction 
 Medicinal products that affect rilpivirine exposure 
 Rilpivirine is primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A .Medicinal products that induce or inhibit CYP3A may thus affect the clearance of rilpivirine (see section 5.2). Co -administration of rilpivirine and medicinal products that induce CYP3A hasbeen observed to decrease theplasma concentrations of rilpivirine ,which could reduce the therapeutic effect of rilpivirine .Co-administration of rilpivirine and medicinal p roducts that inhibit CYP3A hasbeen observed toincrease the plasma concentrations of rilpivirine .Co-administration of rilpivirine with medicinal products that increase gastric p 
 H may result indecrease dplasma concentrations of rilpivirine which could po tentially reduce the therapeutic effect of EDURANT .Medicinal products that are affected by the use of rilpivirine 
 Rilpivirine at a dose of 25 mg once daily is not likely to have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure of medicinal products metabolis ed by CYP enzymes.Rilpivirin einhibits P -glycoprotein in vitro (IC50is 9.2 μM). In a clinical study ,rilpivirin edid not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. However, it may not be completely excluded that rilpivirin ecan increase the ex posure to other medicines transported by P-glycoprotein that are more sensitive to intestinal P -gp inhibition, e.g. dabigatran etexilate.Rilpivirine is an in vitro inhibitor of the transporter MATE -2K with an IC50of < 2.7n

*The interaction between rilpivirine and the medicinal produ ct was evaluated in a clinical study. All other drug -drug interactions shown are predicted.
#This interaction study has been performed with a dose higher than the recommended dose for rilpivirine assessing the maximal effect on the co -administered medicin al product. The dosing recommendation is applicable to the recommended dose of rilpivirine of 25 mg once daily .
†This interaction study has been performed with a dose higher than the recommended dose for rilpivirine .QT prolonging medicinal products 
 There is limited information available on the potential for a pharmacodynamic interaction between rilpivirine and medicinal products that prolong the QTc interval of the ECG . In a study of healthy subjects, supratherapeutic doses of rilpivirine (75 mg once d ailyand 300 mg once daily ) have been 10shown to prolong the QTc interval of the ECG (see section 5.1). EDURANT should be used with caution when co -administered with a medicinal product with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes.
