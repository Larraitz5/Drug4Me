4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Somatostatin and its analogues are probably competing to bind to the same somatostatin receptors. Therefore, when treating patients with somatostatin analogues , it is preferable to perform imaging with gallium (68Ga) edotreotide the day(s) preceding the next administration of a somatostatin analogue.  A long -term exposure to endogenous hypercortisolism may down -regulate somatostatin receptor expression and negatively influence the results of somatostatin receptor imaging with gallium (68Ga) edotreotide . In patients with Cushing syndrome, the normalisation of hypercortisolism should be  considered  before performing PET with Soma 
 Kit  TOC.  
 Some evidence exists that corticosteroids can induce down -regulation of somatostatin subtype  2 receptors (SSTR2). Repeated administration of high -doses of glucocorticosteroids prior to gallium (68Ga) edotreotide administration may cause insufficient SSTR2 expression for adequate visuali sation of somatostatin receptor -positive NETs.
