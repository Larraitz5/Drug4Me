4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 In a study of 15 healthy subjects administered digoxin daily to steady state, a single teriparatide dose did not alter the cardiac effect of digoxin. However, sporadic case reports have suggested that hypercalcaemia may predispose pat ients to digitalis toxicity. Because teriparatide transiently increases serum calcium, teriparatide should be used with caution in patients taking digitalis.Teriparatide has been evaluated in pharmacodynamic interaction studies with hydrochlorothiazide. No clinically significant interactions were noted.Co-administration of raloxifene or hormone replacement therapy with teriparatide did not alter the effects of teriparatide on serum or urine calcium or on clinical adverse events.5
