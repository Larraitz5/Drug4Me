 No interaction  studies  have been performed  (see section 5.2) . 
 Solriamfetol  must  not be administered  concomitantly  with MAOIs  or within  14 days after MAOI  treatment  has been discontinued  because  it may increase  the risk of a hypertensive  reaction  (see section  4.3). 
  Concomitant  use of medicinal  products that  increase  blood  pressure  and heart  rate should  be used with caution  (see section  4.4). 
 Medicinal products that increase levels of dopamine or that bind directly to dopamine receptors might result in pharmacodynamic interactions with solriamfetol. Concomitant use of such medicinal products should be used with caution.
