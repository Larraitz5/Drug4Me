4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.  
 12 Concomitant administration of a single dose of 10 mg/kg tocilizumab  with 10- 25 mg MTX once weekly had no clinically significant effect on MTX exposure.  
 Population pharmacokinetic analyses did not detect any effect of MTX, non- steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids on tociliz umab clearance.  
 The expression of hepatic CYP450 enzymes is suppressed by cytokines, such as IL -6, that stimulate chronic inflammation. Thus, CYP450 expr ession may be reversed when potent cytokine inhibitory therapy, such as tocilizumab, is introduced.  
 In vitro  studies with cultured human hepatocytes demonstrated that IL -6 caused a reduction in CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 enzyme expression. Tociliz umab normalises expression of these enzymes.  
 In a study in RA patients, levels of simvastatin (CYP3A4) were decreased by 57% one week following a single dose of tocilizumab, to the level similar to, or slightly higher than, those observed in healthy subje cts.  
 When starting or stopping therapy with tocilizumab, patients taking medicinal products which are individually adjusted and are metabolised via CYP450 3A4, 1A2 or 2C9 (e.g. . methylprednisolone , dexamethasone, (with the possibility for oral glucocort icoid withdrawal syndrome), atorvastatin, calcium channel blockers, theophylline, warfarin, phenprocoumon, phenytoin, ciclosporin, or benzodiazepines) should be monitored as doses may need to be increased to maintain therapeutic effect. Given its long elim ination half -life (t 1/2), the effect of tocilizumab on CYP450 enzyme activity may persist for several weeks after stopping therapy.
