4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 REKAMBYS ,in combination with cabotegravir injection, is intended for use as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV -1 infection and should not be administered with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of HIV -1. Therefore, information regarding drug -drug interactions with other antiretroviral medicinal products is not provided. From a drug interaction perspective, t here are no limitations on the use of other antiretroviral medicinal products after discontinuin g REKAMBYS.For the oral lead -in rilpivirine treatment and in case missed doses are replaced by oral rilpivirine treatment, refer to the oral rilpivirine tablet Sm 
 PC for information about drug interactions .Medicinal products that affect rilpivirine expo sure 
 Rilpivirine is primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A .Medicinal products that induce or inhibit CYP3A may thus affect the clearance of rilpivirine (see section 5.2). Co -administration of rilpivirine and medicinal products that induce CYP3A hasbeen observed to decrease theplasma concentrations of rilpivirine ,which could reduce the therapeutic effect of rilpivirine .Co-administration of rilpivirine and medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A hasbeen o bserved toincrease the plasma concentrations of rilpivirine .When using oral rilpivirine, proton pump inhibitors are contraindicated (see rilpivirine tablet Sm 
 PC , section 4.3).Medicinal products that are affected by the use of rilpivirine 
 Rilpivirine is not likely to have a clinically relevant effe ct on the exposure of medicinal products metabolised by CYP enzymes.Rilpivirin einhibits P -glycoprotein in vitro (IC50is 9.2μM). In a clinical study ,oral rilpivirin e(25mgonce daily )did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin.Rilpivirine is an in vitro inhibitor of the transporter MATE -2K with an IC50of < 2.7n 
 M. The clinical implications of this finding are currently unknown .9Interaction table 
 Selected established and theoretical interactions between rilpivirine and co -administered medicinal products are listed in Table 6and are based on the studies conducted with oral rilpivirine or are potential drug interactions that may occur (increase is i ndicated as “ ↑”, decrease as “ ↓”, no change as 
“↔”, not applicable as “N A”, confidence interval as “CI”) .Table 6 Interactions anddoserecommendations with other medicinal products

Ω% increase/decrease based on D rug-Drug Interaction studies with oral rilpivirine
*The interaction between rilpivirine and the medicinal product was evaluated in a clinical study. All other drug -drug interactions shown are predicted.
#This interaction study has been performed with a dose higher than the recommended dose for rilpivirine assessing the maximal effect on the co -administered medicinal product. The dosing recommendation is applicable to the recommended dose of rilpivirine of 2 5mg once daily.QT prolonging medicinal products 
 Oral rilpivirine at the recommended dose of 25 mg once daily is not associated with a clinically relevant effect on QTc. Rilpivirine p lasma concentrations after REKAMBYS injections at the recommended dose of 600 mg monthly or 900 mg e very 2months ,are comparable to those achieved with oral rilpivirine at a dose of 25 mg qd. In a study of healthy subjects, supratherapeutic doses of oral rilpivirine (75 mg once daily and 300 mg once daily) have been shown to prolong the QTc interval of the ECG (see section 5.1). REKAMBYS sho uld be used with caution when co -administered with a medicinal product with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes (see section 4.4).
