4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No interaction of treosulfan was observed in high- dose chemotherapy.  
 Detailed in vitro  studies did not completely exclude potential interactions between high plasma concentrations of treosulfan and CYP3A4, CYP2C19, or P-glycoprotein ( P-gp) substrates. Physiologically -based pharmacokinetic modelling predicted a weak (AUC rat io ≥ 1.25 and <  2) to moderate (AUC ratio ≥  2 and < 5) interaction for CYP3A4, a weak interaction for CYP2C19, and a negligible (AUC ratio < 1.25) interaction for P-gp. Therefore, medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. digoxin) that are s ubstrates for CYP3A4  or CYP2C19 should not be given during treatment with treosulfan. Considering overall timing of treatments and the respective pharmacokinetic properties of concomitantly used medicinal products (e.g. half-life), the interaction potential can be reduced to “no interaction” (AUC ratio <  1.25), if all concomitantly used medicinal products  are dosed 2  hours before or 8 hours  after the 2 -hour intravenous infusion of treosulfan . 
 The effect of treosulfan on the pharmacokinetics of fludarabine is not known.
