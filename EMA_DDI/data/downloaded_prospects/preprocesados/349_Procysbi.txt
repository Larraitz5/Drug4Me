4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 It cannot be excluded that cysteamine is a clinically relevant inducer of CYP enzymes, inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP at the intestinal level and inhibitor of liver uptake transporters (OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OCT1).  
 Co-administration with electrolyte and mineral replacement  
 Cysteamine can be administered with electrolyte (except bicarbonate) and mineral replacements necessary for management of Fanconi syndrome as well as vitamin D and thyroid hormone. Bicarbonate should be administered at least one hour before or one hour after PROCYSBI to avoid potential earlier release o f cysteamine.  
 Indomethacin and cysteamine have been used simultaneously in some patients. In cases of patients with kidney transplants, anti -rejection treatments have been used with cysteamine.  
 Co-administration of the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole and PROCYSBI in vivo  showed no effects on cysteamine bitartrate exposure.
