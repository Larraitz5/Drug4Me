4.5 Interaction with other medicina l products and other forms of interaction 
 Medicinal products that affect etravirine exposure 
 Etravirine is metabolised by CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 followed by glucuronidation of the metabolites by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (UDPGT). M edicinal products that 7induce CYP3A4, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 may increase the clearance of etravirine, resulting in lowered plasma concentrations of etravirine.Co-administration of etravirine and medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A4, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 may decrease the clearance of etravirine and may result in increased plasma concentrations of etravirine.Medicinal products that are affected by the use of etravirine 
 Etravirine is a weak inducer of CYP3A4. Co -administration of etravirine with medicinal produ cts primarily metabolised by CYP3A4 may result in decreased plasma concentrations of such medicinal products, which could decrease or shorten their therapeutic effects.Etravirine is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Etravirine is also a weak inhibit or of P-glycoprotein. Co -administration with medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 ,or transported by P -glycoprotein ,may result in increased plasma concentrations of such medicinal products, which could increase or prolong their th erapeutic effect or alter their adverse events profile.Known and theoretical interactions with selected antiretrovirals and non -antiretroviral medicinal products are listed in table 2.The table isnot all -inclusive .Interaction table 
 Interactions betw een etravirine and co -administered medicinal products are listed in table 2(increase is indicated as “ ↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”, not done as “ND”, confidence interval as

 Efavirenz 
 Nevirapine 
 Rilpivirine 
 Com bining two NNRTIs has not been shown to be beneficial. Concomitant use of etravirine with efavirenz or nevirapine may cause a significant decrease in the plasma concentration of etravirine and loss of therapeutic effect of etravirine .Concomitant use of etravirine with rilpivirine may cause a decrease in the plasma concentration of rilpivirine and loss of therapeutic effect of rilpivirine.It is not recommended to co-administer INTELENCE with other NNRTIs.HIV Protease I nhibitors ( PIs)–Unboosted (i.e. without co -administration of low -dose ritonavir)Indinavir Concomitant use of etravirine with indinavir may cause a significant decrease in the plasma concentration of indinavir and loss of therapeutic effect of indinavir .It is not recommended to co-administer INTELENCE with indinavir.HIV P Is –Boosted with low -dose ritonavir

 Etravirine significantly reduced plasma concentrations of dolutegravir. The effect of etravirine on dolutegravir plasma concentrations was mitigated by co-administration of darunavir/ritonavir or lopinavir/ritonavir, and isexpected to be mitigated by atazanavir/ritonavir.INTELENCE should only be used with dolutegravir when co-administered with atazanavir/ritonavir,darunavir/ritonavir, or lopinavir/ritonavir.

14-OH-clarithromycin, were increased. Because 
14-OH-clarithromycin has reduced activi ty against Mycobacterium aviumcomplex (MAC), overall activity against this pathogen may be altered; therefore alternatives to clarithromycin should be considered for the treatment of MAC.ANTICOAGULANTSWarfarin Not studied.

 Ketoconazole 
 Posaconazole 
 Not studied. Posaconazole , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, may increase plasma conce ntrations of etravirine. Itraconazole and ketoconazole are potent inhibitors as well as substrates of CYP3A4. Concomitant systemic use of itraconazole or ketoconazole and etravirine may increase plasma concentrations of etravirine. Simultaneously, plasma c oncentrations of itraconazole or ketoconazole may be decreased by etravirine .INTELENCE and these antifungals can be used without dose adjustments.Voriconazole

No dose adjustment is needed for INTELENCE.ANTIMYCOBACTERIALSRifampicin
