4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 No interaction studies have been performed. Cerliponase alfa is a recombinant human protein and systemic exposure is limited due to intracerebroventricular administration , therefore interactions between cerliponase alfa and medicinal products metabolised by cytochrome  P450 enzymes are unlikely to occur.
