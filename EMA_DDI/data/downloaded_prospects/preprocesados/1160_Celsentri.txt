4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction   
 Maraviroc is metabolised by cytochrome P450 CYP3A4  and CYP3A 5. Co-administration of maraviroc  with medicinal products that induce CYP3A4 may decrease maraviroc concentrations and reduce its therapeutic effects. Co -administration of maraviroc  with medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase maraviroc plasma concentrations. Dose adjustment of maraviroc  is recommended when maraviroc  is co-administered with  potent  CYP3A4 inhibitors and/or inducers. Further details for concomitantly adminis tered medicinal products are provided below (see Table 
2).  
 Maraviroc is a substrate for the transporters P -glycoprotein and OAT P1B1, but the effect of these transporters on the exposure to maraviroc is not known.  
 Based on the in vitro  and clinical data,  the potential for maraviroc to affect the pharmacokinetics of co-administered medicinal products is low.   In vitro  studies have shown that maraviroc does not inhibit OATP1B1, MRP2 or any of  the major P450 enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations (CYP 1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4). Maraviroc had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, the oral contraceptives ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel, or urinary 6β -hydroxycortisol/cortisol ratio, suggestin g no inhibition or induction of CYP3A4 in vivo . At higher exposure of maraviroc a potential inhibition of CYP2D6 cannot be excluded.

  Renal clearance accounts for approximately 23% of total clearance of maraviroc when maraviroc is administered without CYP3A4 inhibitors. In vitro  studies have shown that maraviroc does not inhibit any of the major renal uptake transporters  at clinically re levant concentrations (OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, OCTN1, and OCTN2). Additionally,  co-administration of maraviroc  with tenofovir (substrate for renal elimination) and cotrimoxazole (contains trimethoprim, a renal cation transport inhibitor), showed no effect on the  pharmacokinetics of maraviroc. In addition, co -administration of maraviroc  with lamivudine/zidovudine showed no effect of maraviroc on lamivudine (primarily renally cleared) or zidovudine (non -P450 metabolism and renal clearance) pharmacokinetics.  Maravi roc inhibits P -glycoprotein in vitro  (IC 50 is 183 μM). However, maraviroc does not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin in vivo .  It may not be excluded that maraviroc can increase the exposure to the P -glycoprotein substrate dabigatran ete xilate.

 Cobicistat is a potent CYP3A inhibitor.  CELSENTRI dose should be decreased to 150 mg twice daily when co -administered with cobicistat containing regimen.

150/100mg QD  (maraviroc 150 mg BID)  Maraviroc AUC 12: ↑ 2.86 (2.33 -3.51)  Maraviroc C max: ↑ 2.15 (1.71 -2.69)  Maraviroc C 12: ↑ 4.23 (3.47 -5.16)  
 Elvitegravir AUC 24: ↔ 1.07 (0.96 -1.18)  Elvitegravir C max: ↔ 1.01 (0.89 -1.15)  Elvitegravir C 24: ↔ 1.09 (0.95 -1.26)  
 Elvitegravir as a single agent is indicated only in combination with certain ritonavir boosted PIs.  
 Elvitegravir per se is not expected to affect maraviroc exposure to a clinically relevant degree and the observed effect is attributed to ritonavir.  
 Thus, CELSENTRI dose should be modified in line with the recommendation for co -administration with respective PI/ritonavir combination (see 
‘Protease Inhibitors’).  Raltegravir 400  mg BID  (maraviroc 300  mg BID)  Maraviroc AUC 12: ↓ 0.86  Maraviroc C max: ↓ 0.79  
 Raltegravir AUC 12: ↓ 0.63  Raltegravir C max: ↓ 0.67  Raltegravir C 12: ↓ 0.72

CELSENTRI dose should be increased to 600  mg twice daily when co-administered with efavirenz in the absence of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor.  For combination with efavirenz + PI, see separate recommendations below.  Etravirine 200 mg BID  (maraviroc 300  mg BID)  Maraviroc AUC 12: ↓ 0.47  Maraviroc C max: ↓ 0.40

Comparison to exposure in historical controls suggests that CELSENTRI 300 mg twice daily and nevirapine can be co -administered without dose adjustment.   Protease Inhibitors ( PIs) Atazanavir 400  mg QD  (maraviroc 300  mg BID)  Maraviroc AUC 12 ↑ 3.57  Maraviroc C max: ↑ 2.09  Atazanavir concentrations not measured, no effect is expected.

CELSENTRI dose should be increased to 600  mg twice daily when co-administered with rifampicin in the absence of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor.  This dose adjustment has not been studied in HIV patients. See also section 4.4.  Rifampicin + efavirenz  Combination with two inducers has not been studied.

When combining rifabutin with protease inhibitors that are potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 a net inhibitory effect on maraviroc is expected.  CELSENTRI dose should be decreased to 150  mg twice daily when co-administered with rifabutin and a PI (except tipranavir/ritonavir where the dose should be 300 mg twice daily).  See also section 4.4.  
 Concomitant use of CELSENTRI and fosamprenavir/ritonavir is not recommended.
