4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 No specific interaction studies have been performed with the bimatoprost / timolol fixed combination.Ther e is a potential for additive effects resulting in hypotension, and/or marked bradycardia when  ophthalmic beta -blockers solution is administered concomitantly with oral calcium channel blockers, guanethidine, beta -adrenergic blocking agents, parasympa thomimetics, anti -arrhythmics (including amiodarone) and digitalis glycosides.Potentiated systemic beta -blockade (e.g., decreased heart rate, depression) has been reported during combined treatment with CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g. quinidine, fluoxetine, paro xetine) and timolol.Mydriasis resulting from concomitant use of ophthalmic beta -blockers and adrenaline (epinephrine) has been reported occasionally.
