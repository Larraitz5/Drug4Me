4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Effect of other medicinal products on trametinib  
 As trametinib is metabolised predominantly via deacetylation mediated by hydrolytic enzymes  (e.g. carboxyl -esterases) , its pharmacokinetics are unlikely to be affected by other agents through metabolic interactions (see section  5.2). Drug -drug interactions  via these hydrolytic enzymes cannot be ruled out and could influence the exposure to trametinib . 
 11 Trametinib is an in vitro  substrate of the efflux transporter P -gp. As it cannot be excluded that strong  inhibition of hepatic P -gp may result in increased levels of trametinib, caution is advised when co -administering trametinib with medicinal products that are strong inhibitors of P -gp (e.g. verapamil, cyclosporine, ritonavir, quinidine, itraconazole) . 
 Effect of trametinib on other medicinal products  
 Based on in vitro  and in vivo  data, trametinib is unlikely to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products via interaction with CYP enzymes or transporters (see section  5.2). Trametinib may result in transient inhibition of BCRP substrates (e.g. pitavastatin) in the gut, which may be minimi sed with staggered dosing (2 hours apart) of these agents and trametinib.  
 Based on clinical data, no loss of efficacy of hormonal contraceptives is expected when co -administered with trametinib monotherapy (see section  5.2). 
 Combination with dabrafenib  
 When trametinib is used in combination with dabrafenib see section s 4.4 and 4.5 of the dabrafenib Sm 
 PC  for interactions . 
 Effect of food on trametinib  
 Patients should take trametinib as monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib at least one hour prior to or two hours after a me al due to the effect of food on tra metinib absorption (see section  4.2 and 5.2).
