4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 Invitro assessment of interactions 
 Linagliptin is a weak competitive and a weak to moderate mechanism -based inhibitor of CYP isozyme CYP3A4, but does not inhibit other CYP isozymes. It is not an inducer of CYP isozymes.Linagliptin is a P -glycoprotein substrate, and inhibits P -glycoprotein mediated transport of digoxin with low potency. Based on these results and invivo interaction studies, linagliptin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with other P -gp substrat es.Invivo assessment of interactions 
 Effects of other medicinal products on linagliptin 
 Clinical data described below suggest that the risk for clinically meaningful interactions by co-administered medicinal products is low.Rifampicin :multiple co -administration of 5 mg linagliptin with rifampicin, a potent inductor of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4, resulted in a 39.6% and 43.8% decreased linagliptin steady -state AUC 4and C max, respectively, and about 30% decreased DPP-4inhibition at trough. Thus, full efficacy of linagliptin in combination with strong P -gp inducers might not be achieved, particularly if these are administ ered long -term. Co-administration with other potent inducers of P -glycoprotein and CYP3A4, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin has not been studied.Ritonavir :co-administration of a single 5 mg oral dose of linagliptin and multiple 200 mg oral doses of ritonavir, a potent inhibitor of P -glycoprotein and CYP3A4, increased the AUC and C maxof linaglipti n approximately twofold and threefold, respectively .The unbound concentrations, which are usually less than 1% at the therapeutic dose of linagliptin, were increased 4 -5-fold after co -administration with rit onavir.Simulations of steady -state plasma conce ntrations of linagliptin with and without ritonavir indicated that the increase in exposure will be not associated with an increased accumulation. These changes in linagliptin pharmacokinetics were not considered to be clinically relevant. Therefore, clini cally relevant interactions would not be expected with other P-glycoprotein/CYP3A4 inhibitors.Metformin :co-administration of multiple three times daily doses of 850 mg metformin with 10 mg linagliptin once daily did not clinical meaningfully alter the p harmacokinetics of linagliptin in healthy volunteers.Sulphonylureas :the steady -state pharmacokinetics of 5 mg linagliptin was not changed by concomitant administration of a single 1.75 mg dose glibenclamide ( glyburide) .Effects of linagliptin on other medicinal products 
 In clinical studies, as described below, linagliptin had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, warfarin, digoxin or oral contraceptives providing invivo evidence of a low propensity for causing medicinal product interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C8, P -glycoprotein, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).Metformin: co-administration of multiple daily doses of 10 mg linagliptin with 850 mg metformin, an OCT substrate , had no relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin in healthy volunteers. Therefore, linagliptin is not an inhibitor of OCT -mediated transport.Sulphonylureas: co-administration of multiple oral doses of 5 mg linagliptin and a single oral dose of 
1.75 mg glibenclamide (glyburide) resulted in clinically not relevant reduction of 14% of both AUC and C maxof glibenclamide. Because glibenclamide is primarily metabolised by CYP2C9, these data also support the conclusion that linagliptin is not a CYP2C9 inhibitor. Clinically meaningful interactions would not be expected with other sul phonylureas (e.g., glipiz ide, tolbutamide, and glimepiride) which, like glibenclamide, are primarily eliminated by CYP2C9.Digoxin: co-administration of multiple daily doses of 5mg linagliptin with multiple doses of 0.25 mg digoxin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxi n in healthy volunteers. Therefore, linagliptin is not an inhibitor of P -glycoprotein -mediated transport invivo.Warfarin: multiple daily doses of 5 mg linagliptin did not alter the pharmacokinetics of S( -) or R(+) warfarin, a CYP2C9 substrate, administe red in a single dose.Simvastatin: multiple daily doses of linagliptin had a minimal effect on the steady -state pharmacokinetics of simvastatin, a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, in healthy volunteers. Following administration of a supratherapeutic dose of 10mg linagliptin concomitantly with 40 mg of simvastatin daily for 6 days, the plasma AUC of simvastatin was increased by 34%, and the plasma Cmaxby 10%.Oral contraceptives: co-administration with 5 mg linagliptin did not alter the steady -state pharmac okinetics of levonorgestrel or ethinylestradiol.5
