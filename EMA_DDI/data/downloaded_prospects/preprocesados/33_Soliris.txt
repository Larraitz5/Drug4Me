4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 No interaction studies have been performed. Based on the potential inhibitory effect of eculizumab on complement- dependent cytotoxicity of rituximab, eculizumab may redu ce the expected pharmacodynamic effects of rituximab.  
 Plasma exchange (PE), plasmapheresis (PP), fresh frozen plasma infusion (PI) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) have been shown to reduce eculizumab serum levels. A supplemental dose of eculizumab  is required in these settings. See Section 4.2 for guidance in case of concomitant PE, PP, PI, or IVIg treatment.   
 Concomitant use of eculizumab  with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg)  may reduce effectiveness of eculizumab . Closely monitor for reduced effe ctiveness of eculizumab . 
 Concomitant use of eculizumab  with neonatal Fc receptor (Fc 
 Rn) blockers may lower systemic exposures and reduce effectiveness of eculizumab . Closely monitor for reduced effectiveness of eculizumab .
