4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.  
 In vitro , emtricitabine did not inhibit metab olism mediated by any of the following human CYP450 isoforms: 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4.  Emtricitabine did not inhibit the enzyme responsible for glucuronidation.  Based on the results of these in  vitro  expe riments and the known elimination pathways of emtricitabine, the potential for CYP450 mediated interactions involving emtricitabine with other medicinal products is low.  There are no clinically significant interactions when emtricitabine is co -administered with indinavir, zidovudine, stavudine, famciclovir or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.  
 Emtricitabine is primarily excreted via glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion.  With the exception of famciclovir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, the ef fect of co -administration of emtricitabine with medicinal products that are excreted by the renal route, or other medicinal products known to affect renal function, has not been evaluated.  Co-administration of emtricitabine with medicinal products that are eliminated by active tubular secretion may lead to an increase in serum concentrations of either emtricitabine or a co -administered medicinal product due to competition for this elimination pathway.  
 There is no clinical experience as yet on the co -admin istration of cytidine analogues.  Consequently, the use of emtricitabine in combination with lamivudine for the treatment of HIV infection cannot be recommended at this time.
