4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 Pharmacokinetic interactions No huma n interaction studies have been perform ed.5EVUSHELD is not expected to undergo metabolism by hepatic enzymes or renal elimination .Tixagevimab and cilgavimab are not renally excreted or metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes; therefore, interactions w ith medicinal products that are renally excreted or that are substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of CYP enzymes are unlikely .Based on pharm acokinetic ( PK)modelling, COVID -19vaccination following EVUSHELDadministration had noclinically relevant impact on the clearance of EVUSHELD .Based on PK modelling, immunocompromised condition had no clinically relevant impact on the clearance of EVUSHELD .Pharmacodynamic interactions 
 No human interaction studies have been performed.
