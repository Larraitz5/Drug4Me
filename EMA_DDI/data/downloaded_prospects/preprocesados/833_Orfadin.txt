4.5 Interaction w ith other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Nitisinone is metabolised in vitro  by CYP  3A4 and d ose-adjustment may therefore be needed when nitisinone is co- administered with inhibitors or inducers of this enzyme.  
 Based on data from a clinical interaction study with 80  mg nitisinone at steady- state, nitisinone is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C9 (2.3- fold increase in tolbutamide AUC) , therefore nitisinone treatment may result in increased plasma concentrations of co- administered medicinal products metabolized primarily via CYP2C9 (see section  4.4).  Nitisinone is a weak inducer of CYP2E1 (30% decreas e in chlorzoxazone AUC) and a weak inhibitor of OAT1 and OAT3  (1.7- fold increase in AUC of furosemide) , whereas nitisin one did not inhibit CYP2D6 (see section  5.2). 
 No formal food interactions studies have been performed with Orfadin hard capsules. However, nitisinone has been co-administered with food during the generation of efficacy and safety data. Therefore, it is re comm ended that if nitisinone treatment with Orfadin hard capsules is initiated with food, this should be maintained on a routine basis, see se ction  4.2.
