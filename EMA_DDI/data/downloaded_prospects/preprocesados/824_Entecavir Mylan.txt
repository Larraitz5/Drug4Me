4.5 Interaction with other medic inal products and other forms o f interaction  
 Since entecavir is predominantly  eliminated by the kidney (see section 5.2), coadministration with medicinal products that reduce r enal function or compete for ac tive tubular secretion may increase serum concentrations o f either medicinal pro duct. Apart from la mivudine, adefovir dipivoxil and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, th e effects of coadministration of entecavir with med icinal products that are excreted renally or affect renal function have not been eva luated. Patients sh ould be monitored closely for adverse reactions when entecavir is coadministered with such medicinal products.  
  No pharmacokinetic interactions between entecavir and lamivudin e, adefovir or tenofovir were observed.  
  Entecavir is not a substrate, an inducer or an inhibitor of cyt ochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes (see section 5.2). Therefore CYP450 mediated active substance intera ctions are unlikely to occur with entecavir.
