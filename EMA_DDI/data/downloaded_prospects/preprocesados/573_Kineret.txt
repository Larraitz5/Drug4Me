4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Interactions between Kineret and other medicinal products have not been investigated in formal studies.  In clinical studies , interactions between Kineret and other medicinal products (including nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory medicinal products, gluco corticoids, and DMARDs) have not been observed. 
 8 Concurrent Kineret and TNF -α antagonist treatment  In a clinical study  with RA patients receiving background methotrexate, patients treated with Kineret and etanercept were observed to have a higher rate of serious infections (7%) and neutropenia than patients treated with etanercept alone and higher than observed in previous studies  where Kineret was used alone. Concurrent Kineret and etanercept treatment has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit. 
 The concurrent use of Kineret with etanercept or any other TNF -α antagonist is not recommended (see section  4.4). 
 Cytochrome P450 Substrates  The formation of CYP450 enzymes is suppressed by increased levels of cytokines (e.g., IL- 1) during chronic inflammation. Thus, it may be expected that for an IL -1 receptor antagonist, such as anakinra, the formation of CYP450 enzymes could be normalized during treatment. This would be clinically relevant for CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. warfarin and phenytoin ). Upon start or end of Kineret treatment in patients on these types of medicinal products, it may be relevant to consider therapeutic monitoring of the effect or concentration of these products and the individual dose of the medicinal product may need to be adjusted.
