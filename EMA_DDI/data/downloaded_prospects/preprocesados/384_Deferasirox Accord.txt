4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 The sa fety of deferasirox  in co mbination with other  iron chela tors has not  been estab lished. Therefore, it must not be co mbined wi th other  iron chela tor the rapies (see section  4.3). 
 Interaction with food  
 The Cmax of de ferasirox  film-coated tablets was inc reased  (by 29%)  when taken wi th a high-fat meal. Deferasirox fil m-coated tablets may be taken either on an e mpty stomach or with a light meal, preferably at the sa me time each day  (see sections  4.2 and 5.2).  
 Agents that may decrease deferasirox  systemic exposu re 
 Deferasirox metabolism depends on U GT enzymes. In a hea lthy volunteer s tudy, the conco mitant administration of  deferasirox  (single dose of  30 mg/kg, dispers ible tablet formulation) and the potent UGT inducer, rifa mpicin, (repea ted dose of  600 mg/day) resulted in a dec rease of de ferasirox exposure by  44% (90% CI: 37% - 51%). Therefore, the conco mitant use of deferasirox with potent UGT inducers (e.g. rifa mpicin, carba mazepine, phen ytoin, phenobarbita l, ritona vir) may result  in a decrease in deferasirox efficac y. The patien tâ€™s serum ferritin shou ld be monitored d uring and after  the co mbination, and the dose of  deferasirox adjusted if necessar y. 
 Cholest yramine si gnificantly  reduced the defe rasirox exposure in a mechan istic study  to de termine the de gree of en terohepatic recycling (see section  5.2). 
 Interaction with midazolam  and o ther agents metabolised by  CYP3A4 
 In a hea lthy volunteer s tudy, the conco mitant administration of  deferasirox dispers ible tablets and midazolam  (a CYP3A4 probe subs trate) resulted in a dec rease of midazolam  exposure by  17% (90% 12 CI: 8% - 26%). In the clinical  settin g, this effect  may be more p ronounced. Therefore, due to a possible dec rease in e fficac y, caution shou ld be exe rcised when deferasirox is co mbined wi th substances metabolised throu gh CYP3A4 (e.g. ciclospo rin, simvastatin, hor monal contraceptive agents, bepridil, ergotamine). 
 Interaction with repa glinide and other  agents metabolised by  CYP2C8 
 In a hea lthy volunteer s tudy, the conco mitant administration of de ferasirox as a moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor (30  mg/kg daily, dispers ible tablet formulation), with repa glinide, a CYP2C8 substra te, given as a s ingle dose of  0.5 mg, increased repa glinide A UC and Cmax about  2.3-fold (90% CI [2.03 -2.63]) and 1.6 -fold (90% CI [1.42-1.84]), respecti vely. Since the interaction has not been  estab lished with doses hi gher than 0.5  mg for repa glinide, the conco mitant use of deferasirox with repa glinide should be a voided. If the co mbination appea rs necessa ry, care ful clinical  and b lood glucose monitoring  shou ld be perfor med (see section  4.4). An inte raction between defe rasirox and other  CYP2C8 substra tes like pac litaxel  cannot  be exc luded.  
 Interaction with theoph ylline and other  agents metabolised by  CYP1A2 
 In a hea lthy volunteer s tudy, the conco mitant administration of  deferasirox  as a C YP1A2 inhibitor (repea ted dose of 30  mg/kg/day, dispers ible tablet formulation) and the CYP1A2 substra te theoph ylline (single dose of  120 mg) resulted in an increase of theoph ylline A UC by 84% (90% CI: 
73% to 95%). The sin gle dose Cmax was not  affected, but  an increase of theoph ylline Cmax is expected to occur with ch ronic dosin g. Therefore, the conco mitant use of  deferasirox  with theoph ylline is not reco mmended. If deferasirox  and theoph ylline are used conco mitantly, monitoring  of theoph ylline concen tration and theoph ylline dose reduction shou ld be cons idered. An interaction be tween de ferasirox and o ther CYP1A2 substra tes cannot  be exc luded. For substances that are predominantly metabolised by  CYP1A2 and that have a na rrow therapeutic index (e.g. clozapine, tizanidine), the sa me recommendations apply  as for theoph ylline.  
 Other infor mation 
 The conco mitant administration of deferasirox  and alu minium-containing antacid prepara tions has not been for mally studied. Al though deferasirox has a lower affinity  for aluminium  than for iron, it  is not recommended to ta ke deferasirox  tablets with aluminium-containing antacid prepara tions.  
 The conco mitant administration of de ferasirox with substances that  have known ulcero genic potential, such as NSAIDs (including  acetylsalic ylic ac id at high dosage), corticoste roids or  oral bisphosphona tes may increase the risk of gastrointestinal  toxic ity (see section  4.4). The conco mitant administration of de ferasirox with an ticoagulants may also increase the risk of gastrointestinal haemorrha ge. Close clinical  monitoring  is required when defe rasirox is co mbined wi th these substances.  
 Concomitant administration of deferasirox and busulfan resulted in an increase of busulfan exposure (AUC), but the mechanism of the interaction remains unclear. If possible, evaluation of the pharmacokinetics (AUC, clearance) of a busulfan test dose should  be performed to allow dose adjustment.
