4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 The inotropic effects of cardiac glycosides are affected by serum calcium levels. Combined use of Natpar and cardiac glycosides (e.g. ,digoxin or digitoxin ) may predispose patients to digitalis toxicity if hypercalcaemia develops. No drug -drug interaction study has been conducted with cardiac glycosides and Natpar (see section 4.4).For any drug that affects serum calcium levels (e.g., lithium, thiazides ), patients â€™serum calcium levels should be monitored.Co-administration of alendronic acid and Natpar may lead to a reduction in the calcium sparing effect, which can interfere with the normali sation of serum calcium. Concomitant use of Natpar with bisphosphonates is not recommended.Natpar is a protein that is not metabolised by and does not inhibit hepatic microsomal drug-metabolising enzymes (e.g. ,cytochrome P450 isoenzymes). Natpar is not protein bound and has a low volume of distribution.7
