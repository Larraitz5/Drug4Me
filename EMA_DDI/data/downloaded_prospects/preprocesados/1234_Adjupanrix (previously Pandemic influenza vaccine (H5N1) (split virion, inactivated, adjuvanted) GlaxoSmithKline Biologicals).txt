4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction   
 There are no data on co- administration of Adjupanrix with other vaccines. If co -administration with another vaccine is considered, immunisation should be carried out on separate limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reac tions may be intensified.  
 The immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant treatment.  
 Following influenza vaccination, false -positive serology test results may be obtained by the ELISA method for antibody to hum an immunodeficiency virus -1 (HIV -1), hepatitis C virus and, especially, HTLV -1. In such cases, the Western blot method is negative.  These transitory false -positive results may be due to Ig 
 M production in response to the vaccine.
