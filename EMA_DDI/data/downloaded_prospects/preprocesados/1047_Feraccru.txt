4.5 Interaction with other medicinal produc ts and other forms of interaction 
 No interaction studies have been performed with ferric maltol . Based on an  in vitro study maltol is glucuronised through UGT1A6 (see section 5.2). 
 Food has  been  shown to inhibit uptake of Feraccru: The treatment  should be taken on  an empty stomach (see section 4. 2) 
 Intravenous ad ministration of iron salts Conco mitant administration of Feraccru and intravenous iron may induce  hypotension or even collapse due to the fast release of iron resulting from saturation of transferrin caused by  intravenous  iron. 
 Medicinal products that may impact absorption and distribution of iron from Feraccru  
 Absorption of oral iron may be reduced by  calcium and magnesium salts (such as magnesium trisilicate). Administration of iron preparations with such co mpounds  should be separated by at least 2 hours 
 Impact of Feraccru on absorption of other medicinal produc ts 
 Oral iron is known to reduce the absorption of penicillamine, b isphospho nates, ciprofloxacin, entacapo ne, levodopa,  levofloxacin, levothyroxine (thyroxine) moxifloxacin, mycophen olate, norfloxacin and ofloxacin. These medicinal products should be given at  least 2 hours apart from Feraccru. 
 Absorption of both iron and antibiotic may be reduced if oral iron is given with tetracycline. Administration of iron preparations and tetracyclines should be separated by  2 to 3 hou rs. 4   Pharmacod ynamic interactions 
 Conco mitant use of iron and dimercaprol is nephrotoxic (see section 4.4) . 
 Conco mitant use of chloramphen icol will delay plasma iron clearance, incorporation of iron into red blood cells and interfere with erythropoiesis (see section 4.4) . 
 Conco mitant use of iron with methyldopa  may antagonise the hypotensive effect of methyldopa  (see section 4.4) .
