4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 Interactions caused by inhibition of P
-glycoprotein
-mediated clearance or
 CYP -mediated clearance ofmedicinal products are unlikely (see section  5.2).Decreases in valproic acid levels that may fall below
 the therapeutic  range have been reported whenvalproic acid was co
-administered with carbapenem agents. The lowered valproic acid levels can leadto inadequate seizure control; therefore, concomitant u se of ertapenem and valproic acid/sodiumvalproate is not recommended and alternative antibacterial or anti
-convulsant therapies should beconsidered.
