4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Due to the unknown  mechanism of deferiprone -induced neutropenia, patients must  not take medicinal products known to be associated with neutropenia or those that can cause agranulocytosis (see section  4.3). 
 Since deferiprone binds to metallic cations, the potential exists for interactions between deferiprone and trivalent cation -dependent medicinal products such as aluminium -based antacids. Therefore, it is not recommended to concomitantly ingest aluminium -based antacids and deferiprone.  
 The safety of concurrent use of deferiprone and vitamin  C has not been formally studied. Based o n the reported adverse interaction that can occur between deferoxamine and vitamin  C, caution should be used when administering deferiprone and vitamin  C concurrently.
