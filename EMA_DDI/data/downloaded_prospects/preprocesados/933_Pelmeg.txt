4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
 Due to the potential sensitivity of rapidly dividing myeloid cells to cytotoxic chemotherapyâ€š Pelmeg  should be administered at least 24  hours after administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy. In clinical trials, pegfilgrastim has been safely administered 14  days before chemotherapy. Concomitant use of Pelmeg  with any chemotherapy agent has not been evaluated in patients. In animal models concomitant administration of pegfilgrastim and 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) or other antimetab olites has been shown to potentiate  myelosuppression.  
 Possible interactions with other haematopoietic growth factors and cytokines have not been specifically investigated in clinical trials.  
 The potential for interaction with lithium, which also promotes the release of neutrophils, has not been specifically investigated. There is no evidence that such an interaction would be harmful.  
 6 The safety and efficacy of Pelmeg  have not been evaluated in patients receiving chemotherapy associated with delayed myelosuppression e.g., nitrosoureas.  
 Specific interaction or metabolism studies have not been performed, however, clinical trials have not indicated an interaction of pegfilgrastim with any other medicinal products.
